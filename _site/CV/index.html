<strong><u>PhD in Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham,
UK:</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><u><em>2015
-2020</em></u></span> <em>Title: Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Spaces</em>
<br> <em>Supervisor: Prof. John Barrett</em>
</summary>
<p>I developed the understanding of finite non-commutative geometries
and how they might be useful in the theory of quantum gravity. <br>
<strong>Mathematical areas studied:</strong> Differential geometry,
non-commutative geometry, quantum geometry, representation theory. <br>
<strong>Key skills developed:</strong> independent working, public
speaking, data analysis using Python, knowledge of Monte Carlo
simulations</p>
<p>For my PhD I worked on an area of mathematics called non-commutative
geometry and how it might be useful in the theory of quantum gravity. My
research was to investigate the use of called <em>fuzzy spaces</em> as
candidates for quantum spacetimes. I investigated the dimension and
volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator.
I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the
possible fuzzy spaces possible.</p>
<p>In pursuit of my research I developed my knowledge of data analysis
using the language Python. I also became familiar with the workings of
Monte Carlo simulations and the application of machine learning to
physical problems. A topic I am very interested in pursuing further.</p>

<h2 id="academic-activities">Academic Activities</h2>
<h3 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h3>
<p>My research interests span a wide area within Mathematical Physics. I
am deeply interested in the mathematical description of the universe
with emphasis on the precise nature of spacetime. With my recent work
investigating the use of noncommutative geometry to model spacetimes
with a high energy cutoff. I also interested in any novel use of
mathematics in physical situations, such as the use of topology and
algebraic methods in condensed matter studies.</p>
<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p>I am an enthusiastic advocate for mathematics and science. I was on
the organisational committee for the international festival Pint of
Science 2019. I helped organise the Nottingham branch where academics
from the University of Nottingham go to the pubs of Nottingham to
explain their current research to the public in an understandable
manner. I am always looking for ways to bring mathematics and science
out of the universities and into public view.</p>
<h3 id="past-research-projects">Past Research Projects</h3>
<p><strong><u>PhD Research Project - Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy
Spaces</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><strong><u>2015-2019</u></strong></span></p>
<center>
<em>Keywords:</em> Noncommutative geometry, Monte Carlo simulations,
spectral geometry, quantum gravity, symmetries in physics
</center>
<p>My PhD research was concerned with the use of finite noncommutative
geometries as candidates for quantum spacetimes. These so-called
<em>fuzzy spaces</em> possess an energy cutoff whilst retaining Lie
group symmetries. My PhD research was to investigate the dimension and
volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator.
I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the
possible fuzzy spaces possible.</p>
<p><strong><u>Masters Research Project - Multiferroicity Emerging from
Frustrated Spin Interactions</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><strong><u>2014-2015</u></strong></span></p>
<center>
<em>Keywords:</em> Solid-state physics, Theoretical physics,
mathematical modelling, frustrated systems, quantum mechanics.
</center>
<p>During the Masters’ year of my undergraduate degree, I undertook a
research project, supervised by Prof. J. Staunton and Dr. J.
Lloyd-Hughes, in which we investigated the various spin configurations
of materials with a multiferroic phase. We aimed to identify what was
special about these materials spin configurations that caused them to
possess a multiferroic phase. This project was conducted with the aim of
aiding the design of high temperature multiferroic devices. We
specifically studied Cupric Oxide (CuO) which has a multiferroic phase
between 213K and 230K, primarily by using mean field model. This project
resulted in a functional model which predicted a multiferroic phase at a
temperature which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental
values.</p>
<p><strong><u>Undergraduate Summer Research - Knotted
Nematics</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><strong><u>August
2014-September 2014</u></strong></span></p>
<center>
<em>Keywords:</em> Condensed Matter, Mathematical Physics, Liquid
Crystals, statistical physics
</center>
<p>This was funded under the Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme
and was supervised under G. P. Alexander at The University of Warwick.
The main aim of this research was to develop a construction for
describing knotted liquid crystals, specifically knotted nematics. We
improved upon existing ideas that used Milnor’s Fibration Theorem and
developed a method to construct the necessary complex polynomial for
Milnor’s theorem, for a given knot.</p>

## Qualifications and Skills

I am fluent in the programming languages Python and C, and very familiar with the software Mathematica. I know how to use Linux, macOS and Windows systems to a high level. I am currently learning basic web development including HTML/CSS and I use Markdown and LaTeX extensively for my note taking. My hobbies include rock climbing and photography/videography usually combining the two. I therefore know how to use photo and video editing software.

I have a valid First Aid Certificate (2017-2020) and an Enhanced DBS check (2017-2020). I also have a clean full drivers licence and motorcycle licence.
