<h2 id="academic-activities">Academic Activities</h2>
<h3 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h3>
<p>My research interests span a wide area within Mathematical Physics. I am deeply interested in the mathematical description of the universe with emphasis on the precise nature of spacetime. With my recent work investigating the use of noncommutative geometry to model spacetimes with a high energy cutoff. I also interested in any novel use of mathematics in physical situations, such as the use of topology and algebraic methods in condensed matter studies.</p>
<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p>I am an enthusiastic advocate for mathematics and science. I was on the organisational committee for the international festival Pint of Science 2019. I helped organise the Nottingham branch where academics from the University of Nottingham go to the pubs of Nottingham to explain their current research to the public in an understandable manner. I am always looking for ways to bring mathematics and science out of the universities and into public view.</p>
<h3 id="past-research-projects">Past Research Projects</h3>
<strong><u>PhD Research Project - Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Spaces</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><strong><u>2015-2019</u></strong></span>
<center>
<em>Keywords:</em> Noncommutative geometry, Monte Carlo simulations, spectral geometry, quantum gravity, symmetries in physics
</center>
<p>My PhD research was concerned with the use of finite noncommutative geometries as candidates for quantum spacetimes. These so-called <em>fuzzy spaces</em> possess an energy cutoff whilst retaining Lie group symmetries. My PhD research was to investigate the dimension and volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator. I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the possible fuzzy spaces possible.</p>
<strong><u>Masters Research Project - Multiferroicity Emerging from Frustrated Spin Interactions</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><strong><u>2014-2015</u></strong></span>
<center>
<em>Keywords:</em> Solid-state physics, Theoretical physics, mathematical modelling, frustrated systems, quantum mechanics.
</center>
<p>During the Masters’ year of my undergraduate degree, I undertook a research project, supervised by Prof. J. Staunton and Dr. J Lloyd-Hughes, in which we investigated the various spin configurations of materials with a multiferroic phase. We aimed to identify what was special about these materials spin configurations that caused them to possess a multiferroic phase. This project was conducted with the aim of aiding the design of high temperature multiferroic devices. We specifically studied Cupric Oxide (CuO) which has a multiferroic phase between 213K and 230K, primarily by using mean field model. This project resulted in a functional model which predicted a multiferroic phase at a temperature which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.</p>
<strong><u>Undergraduate Summer Research - Knotted Nematics</u></strong> <span style="float:right;"><strong><u>August 2014-September 2014</u></strong></span>
<center>
<em>Keywords:</em> Condensed Matter, Mathematical Physics, Liquid Crystals, statistical physics
</center>
<p>This was funded under the Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme and was supervised under G P Alexander at The University of Warwick. The main aim of this research was to develop a construction for describing knotted liquid crystals, specifically knotted nematics. We improved upon existing ideas that used Milnor’s Fibration Theorem and developed a method to construct the necessary complex polynomial for Milnor’s theorem, for a given knot.</p>

## Qualifications and Skills

I am fluent in the programming languages Python and C, and very familiar with the software Mathematica. I know how to use Linux, macOS and Windows systems to a high level. I am currently learning basic web development including HTML/CSS and I use Markdown and LaTeX extensively for my note taking. My hobbies include rock climbing and photography/videography usually combining the two. I therefore know how to use photo and video editing software.

I have a valid First Aid Certificate (2017-2020) and an Enhanced DBS check (2017-2020). I also have a clean full drivers licence and motorcycle licence.
