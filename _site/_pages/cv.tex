\textbf{PhD in Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK:}
{\emph{2015 -2020}} \emph{Title: Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Spaces}
\emph{Supervisor: Prof.~John Barrett}

I developed the understanding of finite non-commutative geometries and
how they might be useful in the theory of quantum gravity.
\textbf{Mathematical areas studied:} Differential geometry,
non-commutative geometry, quantum geometry, representation theory.
\textbf{Key skills developed:} independent working, public speaking,
data analysis using Python, knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations

For my PhD I worked on an area of mathematics called non-commutative
geometry and how it might be useful in the theory of quantum gravity. My
research was to investigate the use of called \emph{fuzzy spaces} as
candidates for quantum spacetimes. I investigated the dimension and
volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator.
I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the
possible fuzzy spaces possible.

In pursuit of my research I developed my knowledge of data analysis
using the language Python. I also became familiar with the workings of
Monte Carlo simulations and the application of machine learning to
physical problems. A topic I am very interested in pursuing further.

  courses such as Introduction to Mathematical Physics (2nd year),
  Differential Equations and Fourier Analysis (2nd year), Applied
  Mathematics (1st year) and more. I also mark the mid-term exams and
  coursework for various modules.

  \textbf{ Non-commutative Geometry Seminar Series for Master Students}
  { \textbf{Oct 2016 - Apr 2017}}

  I organised and delivered a seminar on topics surrounding my research
  over the course of two semesters. The seminar was delivered to masters
  students at the University of Nottingham. The was regularly attended
  by around 10 students despite it not being for credit towards their
  degree. The course resulted in two students choosing noncommutative
  geometry as the subject for their masters dissertation, and one of the
  students chose to undertake a PhD with my supervisor. Some lecture
  notes suitable for a UK masters student were developed on the
  foundational results of non-commutative geometry.

  the Physics department at Warwick university. My role included taking
  the prospective students on tours of the campus, informing them of
  important and interesting aspects of the university. I was also given
  the responsibility to present experiments to prospective students,
  engaging them with thought provoking questions. I was also part of the
  team to inform the prospective students about the courses available by
  the Physics department and answer any questions they may have about
  life at university.

  I was part of the team that unpackaged new deliveries of clothes and
  prepare clothing to be presented on the store floor. This required
  adaptability as each delivery changed in size. As well as good team
  work and communication as the unpacking procedure was split in to
  various stages, with a separate person per stage. As well as working
  in an efficient manner. I was also responsible for searching and

My research interests span a wide area within Mathematical Physics. I am
deeply interested in the mathematical description of the universe with
emphasis on the precise nature of spacetime. With my recent work
investigating the use of noncommutative geometry to model spacetimes
with a high energy cutoff. I also interested in any novel use of
mathematics in physical situations, such as the use of topology and
algebraic methods in condensed matter studies.

\hypertarget{outreach}{%

I am an enthusiastic advocate for mathematics and science. I was on the
organisational committee for the international festival Pint of Science
2019. I helped organise the Nottingham branch where academics from the
University of Nottingham go to the pubs of Nottingham to explain their
current research to the public in an understandable manner. I am always
looking for ways to bring mathematics and science out of the
universities and into public view.

\hypertarget{past-research-projects}{%
\subsubsection{Past Research Projects}\label{past-research-projects}}

\textbf{PhD Research Project - Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Spaces}
{\textbf{2015-2019}}

\emph{Keywords:} Noncommutative geometry, Monte Carlo simulations,
spectral geometry, quantum gravity, symmetries in physics

My PhD research was concerned with the use of finite noncommutative
geometries as candidates for quantum spacetimes. These so-called
\emph{fuzzy spaces} possess an energy cutoff whilst retaining Lie group
symmetries. My PhD research was to investigate the dimension and volume
of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator. I also
investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the
possible fuzzy spaces possible.

\textbf{Masters Research Project - Multiferroicity Emerging from
Frustrated Spin Interactions} {\textbf{2014-2015}}

\emph{Keywords:} Solid-state physics, Theoretical physics, mathematical
modelling, frustrated systems, quantum mechanics.

During the Masters' year of my undergraduate degree, I undertook a
research project, supervised by Prof.~J. Staunton and Dr.~J.
Lloyd-Hughes, in which we investigated the various spin configurations
of materials with a multiferroic phase. We aimed to identify what was
special about these materials spin configurations that caused them to
possess a multiferroic phase. This project was conducted with the aim of
aiding the design of high temperature multiferroic devices. We
specifically studied Cupric Oxide (CuO) which has a multiferroic phase
between 213K and 230K, primarily by using mean field model. This project
resulted in a functional model which predicted a multiferroic phase at a
temperature which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental
values.

\textbf{Undergraduate Summer Research - Knotted Nematics}
{\textbf{August 2014-September 2014}}

\emph{Keywords:} Condensed Matter, Mathematical Physics, Liquid
Crystals, statistical physics

This was funded under the Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme and
was supervised under G. P. Alexander at The University of Warwick. The
main aim of this research was to develop a construction for describing
knotted liquid crystals, specifically knotted nematics. We improved upon
existing ideas that used Milnor's Fibration Theorem and developed a
method to construct the necessary complex polynomial for Milnor's
theorem, for a given knot.
