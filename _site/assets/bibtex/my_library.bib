We show that the seminorm coming from commutators with this Dirac operator provides the Podleś sphere with the structure of a compact quantum metric space in the sense of Rieffel.}},

Along with some other bits and pieces to make them work as projectors and G-W generators. The bits that change is that L can be taken to act on the left by left matrix multiplication or on the right by right matrix multiplication. Here they are using some form of matrix conjugation to form the right action like John outlines.
They then form Dirac operators from the two G-W generators (one from the left projector and one from the right projector). This operator corresponds to the continuum limit operator, and they form a Chirality operator which corresponds to the continuum operator also. They do not consider the operators generated by Watamura-Watamura. They then go on to consider higher spin versions, i.e. instead of taking the Pauli matrices, I think they take different dimensional reps.},

The fourfold ℳmax arises from a generic elliptic fibration over a specific toric threefold base Bmax, and gives a geometrically non-Higgsable gauge group of E89 × F48 × (G2 × SU(2))16, of which we expect some factors to be broken by G-flux to smaller groups. It is not possible to tune an SU(5) GUT group on any further divisors in ℳmax, or even an SU(2) or SU(3), so the standard model gauge group appears to arise in this context only from a broken E8 factor. The results of this paper can either be interpreted as providing a framework for predicting how the standard model arises most naturally in F-theory and the types of dark matter to be found in a typical F-theory compactification, or as a challenge to string theorists to explain why other choices of vacua are not exponentially unlikely compared to F-theory compactifications on ℳmax.}},

abstract = {{The spectral dimension is an indicator of geometry and topology of spacetime and a tool to compare the description of quantum geometry in various approaches to quantum gravity. This is possible because it can be defined not only on smooth geometries but also on discrete (e.g., simplicial) ones. In this paper, we consider the spectral dimension of quantum states of spatial geometry defined on combinatorial complexes endowed with additional algebraic data: the kinematical quantum states of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Preliminarily, the effects of topology and discreteness of classical discrete geometries are studied in a systematic manner. We look for states reproducing the spectral dimension of a classical space in the appropriate regime. We also test the hypothesis that in LQG, as in other approaches, there is a scale dependence of the spectral dimension, which runs from the topological dimension at large scales to a smaller one at short distances. While our results do not give any strong support to this hypothesis, we can however pinpoint when the topological dimension is reproduced by LQG quantum states. Overall, by exploring the interplay of combinatorial, topological and geometrical effects, and by considering various kinds of quantum states such as coherent states and their superpositions, we find that the spectral dimension of discrete quantum geometries is more sensitive to the underlying combinatorial structures than to the details of the additional data associated with them.}},

These moments of moments have played an important role in recent investigations of the extreme value statistics of characteristic polynomials and their connections with log-correlated Gaussian fields. Our approach is based on a new combinatorial representation of the moments using the theory of symmetric functions, and an analysis of a second representation in terms of multiple contour integrals. Our main result is that the moments of moments are polynomials in N of degree k2β2-k+1. This resolves a conjecture of Fyodorov and Keating (Philos Trans R Soc A 372(2007):20120503, 2014) concerning the scaling of the moments with N as N→∞, for k,β∈N.

Already the 19th century founders of modern geometry contemplated the possibility that a piece of empty space that looks completely smooth and structureless to the naked eye might have an intricate microstructure at a much smaller scale. Our vastly increased understanding of the physical world acquired during the 20th century has made this a certainty. The laws of quantum theory tell us that looking at spacetime at ever smaller scales requires ever larger energies and, according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, this will alter spacetime itself: it will acquire structure in the form of curvature. What we still lack is a definitive theory of quantum gravity to give us a detailed and quantitative description of the highly curved and quantum-fluctuating geometry of spacetime at this so-called Planck scale. This article outlines a particular approach to constructing such a theory, that of Causal Dynamical Triangulations, and its achievements so far in deriving from first principles why spacetime is what it is, from the tiniest realms of the quantum to the large-scale structure of the universe.}},

The classification includes all possible magnetic topological crystalline insulators protected by point group symmetry. Whereas the classification of topological insulators is known to be given by the K-theory in the momentum space, computation of the K-theory has been a difficult task in the presence of complicated crystallographic symmetry. Here we consider the K-homology in the real space for this problem, instead of the K-theory in the momentum space, both of which give the same topological classification. We apply the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for computation of the K-homology, which is a mathematical tool for generalized (co)homology. In the real-space picture, the AHSS naturally gives the classification of higher-order topological insulators at the same time. By solving the group extension problem in the AHSS on the basis of physical arguments, we completely determine possible topological phases including higher-order ones for each point group. Relationships among different higher-order topological phases are argued in terms of the AHSS in the K-homology. We find that in some nonmagnetic and magnetic point groups, a stack of two Z2 second-order topological insulators can be smoothly deformed into nontrivial fourth-order topological insulators, which implies nontrivial group extensions in the AHSS.}},

abstract = {{It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a  or a  topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via 'dimensional reduction' by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in 'Kaluza–Klein'-like fashion). For -topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The -topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent -topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle–hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern–Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d=1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).}},

As a further application we prove a curved version of this integration formula in terms of the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined by an arbitrary Riemannian metric. For the class of so-called self-compatible Riemannian metrics (including the conformally flat metrics of Connes-Tretkoff) this shows that Connes' noncommutative integral allows us to recover the Riemannian density. This exhibits a neat link between this notion of noncommutative integral and noncommutative measure theory in the sense of operator algebras. As an application of these results, we setup a natural notion of scalar curvature for curved noncommutative tori.}},

Deformation maps between classical and quantum symmetry, the \$U\_q(SU(2))\$ module structure of quantum spheres and the structure of indecomposable representations of \$U\_q(SU(2))\$ at roots of unity conspire in an interesting way to allow the relation between manifestly \$U\_q(SU(2)\$ symmetric spheres and manifestly U(SU(2)) symmetric spheres. The relation suggests that a subset of field theory actions on the q-sphere are equivalent to actions on the fuzzy sphere.

This resembles a property of the canonical spectral triple of a closed oriented Riemannian manifold: there is a dense subspace of H that is a self-Morita equivalence Cl\_D(A)-bimodule. In this paper we argue that on manifolds, in order for the self-Morita equivalence to be implemented by a reality operator J, one has to introduce a "twist" and weaken one of the axioms of real spectral triples.

At the end, I decide against just selling my mathematical wares, and for a survey, necessarily very selective, but taking a global phenomenological approach to its subject matter. After all, noncommutative geometry does not purport yet to solve the riddle of quantum gravity; it is more of an insurance policy against the probable failure of the other approaches. The plan is as follows: the introduction invites students to the fruitful doubts and conundrums besetting the application of even classical gravity. Next, the first experiments detecting quantum gravitational states inoculate us a healthy dose of scepticism on some of the current ideologies. In Sect. 1.3 we look at the action for general relativity as a consequence of gauge theory for quantum tensor fields. Section 1.4 briefly deals with the unimodular variants. Section 1.5 arrives at noncommutative geometry. I am convinced that, if this is to play a role in quantum gravity, commutative and noncommutative manifolds must be treated on the same footing, which justifies the place granted to the reconstruction theorem. Together with Sect. 1.3, this part constitutes the main body of the notes. Only very summarily at the end of this section do we point to some approaches to gravity within the noncommutative realm. The last section delivers a last dose of scepticism. My efforts will have been rewarded if someone from the young generation learns to mistrust current mindsets.}},

This method has the advantage of yielding real Euclidean metrics, even in spacetimes which are not static. When applied to a black hole exterior, the null generators of the event horizon reduce to points in the Euclidean spacetime. Requiring that the Wick rotated holonomy of the null generators be trivial ensures the absence of a `conical singularity' in the Euclidean space. To illustrate the basic idea, we use the tangent space Wick rotation to compute the Hawking temperature by Euclidean methods in a few spacetimes including the Kerr black hole.}},

The opposite approach is 'gravitizing QT' where we attempt to keep the principles of GR, such as the equivalence principle, and consider how this leads to modifications of QT. What we are most lacking in understanding which route to take, if either, is experimental guidance. Here we consider using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to search for clues. In particular, we study how a single BEC in a superposition of two locations could test a gravitizing QT proposal where wavefunction collapse emerges from a unified theory as an objective process, resolving the measurement problem of QT. Such a modification to QT due to general relativistic principles is testable at the Planck mass scale, which is much closer to experiments than the Planck length scale where quantum, general relativistic effects are traditionally anticipated in quantum gravity theories. Furthermore, experimental tests of this proposal should be simpler to perform than recently suggested experiments that would test the quantizing gravity approach in the Newtonian gravity limit by searching for entanglement between two massive systems that are both in a superposition of two locations.}},

These materials are of great interest since they may support electrical currents that flow without resistance, even at zero magnetic field. To date, the quantum anomalous Hall effect has been investigated using low-frequency transport measurements. However, transport results can be difficult to interpret due to the presence of parallel conductive paths, or because additional non-chiral edge channels may exist. Here we move beyond transport measurements by probing the microwave response of a magnetised disk of Cr-(Bi,Sb)2Te3. We identify features associated with chiral edge plasmons, a signature that robust edge channels are intrinsic to this material system. Our results provide a measure of the velocity of edge excitations without contacting the sample, and pave the way for an on-chip circuit element of practical importance: the zero-field microwave circulator. Direct measurement of edge transport in the quantum anomalous Hall effect can be made difficult due to the presence of parallel conductive paths. Here, Mahoney et al. report features associated with chiral edge plasmons, a signature of robust edge states, by probing the zero-field microwave response of a magnetised disk of Cr-(Bi,Sb)2Te3.}},

abstract = {{John Stuart Dowker was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, on 18 March 1937. His life, therefore, was very much influenced by the Second World War. This is evident as his father died on active service in 1945, after being called up in 1941. His grandfather also died shortly afterwards, so he did not know either of them very well. Nevertheless, it seems that he picked up a positive attitude towards natural sciences as both were technically minded. His mother later provided, often from borrowed money, all the necessary intellectual food in forms of chemistry sets, slide rules and other things that a boy needed to develop his interests. Stuart scored excellently in the 11-plus exam, which was used to decide the type of school a pupil should attend after primary school. Although Stuart was generally allowed to do what he wanted, his mother insisted that he chose King Edward VII Grammar School (KES), the top school in Sheffield at the time. KES allowed Stuart to fully develop his intellectual abilities, and after the S-level exam he received a prestigious state scholarship which allowed him to study at any university in the country. He picked Nottingham over other possibilities, mainly because of his interest in electronics and because of the relative proximity to his family. In Nottingham, where he stayed from 1955 to 1958, his research concentration turned out to be mostly solid state physics. But with time on his hands, Stuart raided the library and taught himself things like complex analysis and quantum mechanics, with de Broglie's La m?canique ondulatoire [1] as one of his favorites. Remarkably, this book already contains a discussion of quantization on curved configuration spaces, a setting so relevant in Stuart's later career. Stuart wanted to investigate quantum field theory for his doctoral thesis. So he wrote, among others, to Rudolph Peierls in Birmingham, and, after being interviewed by Peierls himself and J G Valatin, he received an offer of a PhD position. He went to Birmingham in 1958, where his supervisor was Leonardo Castillejo, best known from the Castillejo?Dalitz?Dyson-ambiguity; see [2]. His thesis involved stripping theory, and on this topic he wrote his first ever publication [3]. Takeaways from that time were that sometimes one simply has to do what one is told, and even more importantly, sometimes one has to get on with a calculation and 'just roll through it'. It was also around that period that Stuart started to learn quantum field theory properly following the developments of Feynman. After his PhD, it was Peierls who helped him to find a position at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1961, which he accepted before he received an offer from CERN. In retrospect, this was probably fortunate as it is where he met his wife, Pwu Yih, to whom he has been married for nearly 50 years. Scientifically he remained somewhat isolated there and spent much of his time learning more about quantum field theory, for example by reading Bogoliubov and Shirkov [4]. His entry point for general relativity was Eddington's The Mathematical Theory of Relativity [5], which together with the works of Julian Schwinger and Bryce de Witt were the most influential ones at that time. A shift of focus to questions in quantum field theory in curved space time took place. After his stay in Philadelphia, in 1963, helped by connections between Abe Klein and Brian Flowers, he went to the University of Manchester, where he remains to this day. This period was only briefly interrupted by a sabbatical in 1978 to 1979 at Austin following an invitation by Bryce de Witt. Looking back, it seems there were two major driving forces or principles that determined much of Stuart's selection of research projects. One of them is the method of images, about which he says:  '...it intrigued me that one problem (charge + plane) could be got from another (just charge) by geometrical reasoning plus uniqueness. Thomson's book [6] took this further. Chapter 5 is devoted to the image and inversion methods and I must have read this closely as there are lots of marginal notes...'  The second principle can be read off from the following quote:  'After reading Eddington circa 1960 it was clear to me (and others of course) there is a strong analogy (at least) between gravitation and electromagnetism ... (His work has very strongly influenced me.) So I played a game of asking for the gravitational analogues of existing electromagnetic concepts. The basic analogue is between field strength/charge and curvature/spin... [in that]  ...spin, in general relativity, plays the passive role that charge plays in electromagnetism in the sense that it is the spin?curvature coupling that knocks a particle off a geodesic.'  It is quite amazing how much of Stuart's work can be traced back to these principles. This is briefly explained in the following by describing some of his most important works. His most cited work [7] fits this bill and can be seen as doing what Julian Schwinger did in [8], for a constant electromagnetic field in the gravitational setting. In more detail he noticed Schulman's work on propagators on the three sphere [9], which he extended to Lie groups; see [10, 11]. He then noticed that having exact propagators, work like Schwinger's could be done and de Sitter space was a natural 'curved' candidate. The paper is best known for the mathematical technique introduced, namely for the zeta function method much used since for the computation of singular quantum field theoretic quantities like effective actions and the Casimir energy. The motivation for introducing this scheme goes back to reading an article of I M Gel'fand about some number theory problem involving zeta functions, image sums, propagators etc. How could an object occurring with other objects physicists were using all the time not be useful? It turned out to be very useful, although in this paper the method was only introduced but actually not used! This is probably the reason that his paper did not receive the same recognition as the one by Hawking [12], where zeta function regularization was mentioned in the title and where it was actually applied to examples in the article. Of course, Stuart's and Raymond's paper hit the pulse of the time in that after Stephen Hawking's announcement about Hawking radiation [13], the quantum field theory in curved space-time frenzy began. He had been interested in that subject for a while, the most important influence being de Witt's Les Houches lectures and also Chris Isham, who introduced him to Dennis Sciama's Oxford group, including Philip Candelas and Derek Raine, in 1973. The project about de Sitter space got somewhat delayed by work on path integrals and the ordering problem until Ray Critchley came by looking for a PhD topic. Several more of his best known papers are in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In the article [14], conformal transformations play a fundamental role. They are used to transform static manifolds to ultra-static ones where a high-temperature expansion of the effective action can be done. The result has since been rediscovered many times for special cases. In the process they also showed results about the conformal transformation of heat kernel coefficients claimed later on by mathematicians. The paper by Kennedy, Critchley and Dowker [15] belongs in the same context. Deutsch and Candelas had shown the occurrence of non-integrable singularities near boundaries of the Casimir energy densities, which made it impossible to obtain global energies by naively integrating local quantities. To resolve that problem, the needed surface counterterms for an arbitrarily shaped smooth boundary in curved space were computed. How does the paper [16] fit into the general scheme? The seed to considering this topic was probably planted when Yakir Aharonov was visiting Birmingham in 1958. In the Aharonov?Bohm effect we have an electromagnetic field with finite extension that impacts particles never entering that region. What is the gravitational analogue for that situation? The analogue concerns the impact a localized curvature has, and the cone is an excellent example to shed light on that question. Related to the method of images, Stuart has done an enormous amount of work on the influence of topology and curvature on quantum field theory. An example is [17], where the vacuum stress?energy tensor for Clifford?Klein forms of the flat or spherical type were computed. Another strand we would like to mention is Stuart's interest in higher spin equations. In [18], Steven Weinberg wrote down a set of higher spin equations that took his fancy. They involved angular momentum theory, which has always pleased Stuart, and the description was an alternative to Roger Penrose's use of two-spinors. Investigating the inconsistencies that arose on coupling to gauge theories, Stuart extended the classic results in [19], from electromagnetism to gravity in accordance with his general philosophy; see, e.g., [20, 21, 22]. Lately, Stuart is best known for his many applications in the context of zeta function regularization and its applications to quantum field theory under external conditions and spectral theory. He can be considered the world expert on particular case calculations with a knowledge of the literature, old and recent, that is not seen very often and which originated in the many hours spent at different (mostly British) libraries. His attitude towards explicit computations is nicely summarized by himself:  'I have always been interested in exact solutions, even if unphysical, so long as they are pretty. They seem to be working mechanisms that fit together, complete in themselves, like a watch.'  The following issue in honour of Stuart's 75th birthday contains contributions that touch upon the various topics he has worked on.

abstract = {{We show that as a result of the axial anomaly, massless fermions at zero temperature define a relativistic quantum superfluid. The anomaly pole implies the existence of a gapless Chiral Density Wave (CDW), i.e. an axion-like acoustic mode of an irrotational and dissipationless Hamiltonian perfect fluid, that is a correlated fermion/anti-fermion pair excitation of the Fermi-Dirac sea. In D = 2 dimensions the chiral superfluid effective action coincides with that of the Schwinger model as e → 0 , and the CDW acoustic mode is precisely the Schwinger boson. Since this identity holds also at zero chiral chemical potential, the Dirac vacuum itself may be viewed as a quantum superfluid state. The CDW collective boson is a U ( 1 ) chiral phase field, which is gapless as a result of a novel, non-linear realization of Goldstone's theorem, extended to this case of symmetry breaking by an anomaly. A new local form of the axial anomaly bosonic effective action in any D even spacetime is given, consistent with superfluidity, and its quantization is shown to be required by the anomalous Schwinger terms in fermion current commutators. In QED4 this collective Goldstone mode appears as a massless pole in the axial anomaly triangle diagram, and is responsible for the macroscopic non-dissipative currents of the Chiral Magnetic and Chiral Separation Effects, as well as the Anomalous Hall Effect. In a constant uniform magnetic field an exact dimensional reduction from D = 4 to D = 2 occurs and the collective e + e − CDW chiral pair excitation propagating along the magnetic field direction is a Chiral Magnetic Wave, which acquires a mass gap M 2 = e 3 B / 2 π 2 . Possible realizations and tests of the theory of collective bosonic excitations due to the anomaly in Dirac/Weyl materials are briefly discussed.}},

Earlier I provided a general precise setting for understanding such statements, in which the matrix algebras are viewed as quantum metric spaces, and convergence is with respect to a quantum Gromov–Hausdorff-type distance. But physicists want even more to treat structures on spheres (and other spaces), such as vector bundles, Yang–Mills functionals, Dirac operators, etc., and they want to approximate these by corresponding structures on matrix algebras. In the present paper we treat this idea for vector bundles. We develop a general precise way for understanding how, for two compact quantum metric spaces that are close together, to a given vector bundle on one of them there can correspond in a natural way a unique vector bundle on the other. We then show explicitly how this works for the case of matrix algebras converging to the 2-sphere.}},

We identify a universal Bott–Dirac operator acting in the Hilbert space over R ∞ and show that it gives rise to the free Hamiltonian both in the case of a scalar field theory and in the case of a Yang–Mills theory. These theories come with a canonical fermionic sector for which the Bott–Dirac operator also provides the Hamiltonian. We prove that Hilbert space representations of algebras of observables exist non-perturbatively for a real scalar theory and for a gauge theory, both with or without the fermionic sectors, and show that the free theories are given by semi-finite spectral triples over the respective configuration spaces.

It is useful to begin the present chapter with an analysis of the general tree amplitude, as it illustrates some patterns that will arise in the higher order amplitudes. We focus on the closed oriented string, and on the three- and four-point amplitudes, which illustrate the important features.

Exact expressions for any matrix size N are derived for the moments of |Z| and Z/Z*, and from these we obtain the asymptotics of the value distributions and cumulants of the real and imaginary parts of log Z as N→∞. In the limit, we show that these two distributions are independent and Gaussian. Costin and Lebowitz [15] previously found the Gaussian limit distribution for Im log Z using a different approach, and our result for the cumulants proves a conjecture made by them in this case. We also calculate the leading order N→∞ asymptotics of the moments of |Z| and Z/Z*. These CUE results are then compared with what is known about the Riemann zeta function ζ (s) on its critical line Re s= 1/2, assuming the Riemann hypothesis. Equating the mean density of the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function at a height T up the critical line with the mean density of the matrix eigenvalues gives a connection between N and T. Invoking this connection, our CUE results coincide with a theorem of Selberg for the value distribution of log ζ(1/2+iT) in the limit T→∞. They are also in close agreement with numerical data computed by Odlyzko [29] for large but finite T. This leads us to a conjecture for the moments of |ζ(1/2+it) |.

abstract = {{Quantum gravity was born as that branch of modern theoretical physics that tries to unify its guiding principles, i.e., quantum mechanics and general relativity. Nowadays it is providing new insight into the unification of all fundamental interactions, while giving rise to new developments in mathematics. The various competing theories, e.g. string theory and loop quantum gravity, have still to be checked against observations. We review the classical and quantum foundations necessary to study field-theory approaches to quantum gravity, the passage from old to new unification in quantum field theory, canonical quantum gravity, the use of functional integrals, the properties of gravitational instantons, the use of spectral zeta-functions in the quantum theory of the universe, Hawking radiation, some theoretical achievements and some key experimental issues.}},

In this thesis we describe in details the general ideas and formalism of spin foam models, and review many of the results obtained recently in this approach. We concentrate, for the case of 3-dimensional quantum gravity, on the Turaev-Viro model, and, in the 4-dimensional case, which is our main concern, on the Barrett-Crane model. In particular, for the Barrett-Crane model: we describe the general ideas behind its construction, and review what has been achieved up to date, discuss in details its links with the classical formulations of gravity as constrained topological field theory; we show a derivation of the model from a lattice gauge theory perspective, in the general case of manifold with boundaries, presenting also a few possible variations of the procedure used, discussing the problems they present; we analyse in details the classical and quantum geometry; we also describe how, from the same perspective, a spin foam model that couples quantum gravity to any gauge theory may be constructed; finally, we describe a general scheme for causal spin foam models, how the Barrett-Crane model can be modified to implement causality and to fit in such a scheme, and the resulting link with the quantum causal set approach to quantum gravity.}},

The reformulation maintains an interesting symmetry between observables and states in the form of a Hopf algebra structure.

The simplest example is a two-parameter algebra-co-algebra KAB which is the unique Hopf algebra extension, such as is possible, of the self-dual Hopf algebra of functions on flat phase space C(R*R). In the limit (A=0,B) the author recovers functions on a curved phase space with curvature proportional to B2 and in another limit (A= infinity , B= infinity ), A/B=h(cross), the author recovers quantum mechanics on R>or=0 with an absorbing wall at the origin. The algebra in this way corresponds to a toy model of quantum mechanics of a particle in one space dimension combined with gravity-like forces. It has an interesting Z2 symmetry interchanging A to or from B, and thereby, in some sense, the quantum element with the geometric element. The compatibility conditions that are solved are a generalisation of the classical Yang-Baxter equations.}},

Over the years since, many more such compactifications were found. In the early 2000s, progress in nonperturbative string theory enabled computing the approximate effective potential for many compactifications, and it was found that they have metastable local minima with small cosmological constant. Thus, string/M theory appears to have many vacuum configurations which could describe our universe. By combining results on these vacua with a measure factor derived using the theory of eternal inflation, one gets a theoretical framework which realizes earlier ideas about the multiverse, including the anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem. We review these arguments and some of the criticisms, with their implications for the prediction of low energy supersymmetry and hidden matter sectors, as well as recent work on a variation on eternal inflation theory motivated by computational complexity considerations.}},

We also derive a novel gauge-covariant expansion of the quark propagator in the form (1/AF) = (aL)/2+1/(Aa) where a = 2/(2l+1) is the lattice spacing on S2F, L is the covariant noncommutative chirality and Aa is an effective Dirac operator which has essentially the same IR spectrum as AF but differes from it on the UV modes. Most remarkably is the fact that both operators share the same limit and thus the above covariant expansion is not available in the continuum theory. The first bit in this expansion (aL)/2 although it vanishes as it stands in the continuum limit, its contribution to the anomaly is exactly the canonical theta term. The contribution of the propagator 1/(Aa) is on the other hand equal to the toplogical Chern-Simons action which in two dimensions vanishes identically.}},

The theory of Kirillov aims at finding all irreducible unitary representations of a given Lie group \$G\$. The first chapter is intended to recall some facts about Lie groups. The most important result is that for a functional \$\textbackslashlambda\$ on the Lie algebra \$\textbackslashmathfrak t\$ of a maximal torus in a compact connected Lie group the stabilizer is of the form \$C(T\_1)\$ for a smaller torus \$T\_1\$. This allows us to define a complex structure on the coadjoint orbit \$\textbackslashmathcal O\_\textbackslashlambda = G/C(T\_1)\$. In the second chapter we present the Borel-Weil Theorem which tells us that all irreducible unitary representations of a compact connected Lie group can be realized in the space of holomorphic sections of the bundle \$G\textbackslashtimes\_\textbackslashtau\textbackslashmathbb C\$, where \$\textbackslashtau\$ is a character of a maximal torus. Finally, in the third chapter we show that coadjoint orbits are symplectic manifolds for which prequantization yields a complex line bundle. Then we investigate for which classes of coadjoint orbits one obtains representations in the space of polarized sections of the prequantum bundle. This will lead us back to the result of Borel-Weil.}},

We are here concerned with the fact that the related research effort has been based mostly on analyses of the "spectral dimension", which involves an unphysical Euclideanization of spacetime and is highly sensitive to the off-shell properties of a theory. As here shown, different formulations of the same physical theory can have wildly different spectral dimension. We propose that dynamical dimensional reduction should be described in terms of the "thermal dimension" which we here introduce, a notion that only depends on the physical content of the theory. We analyze a few models with dynamical reduction both of the spectral dimension and of our thermal dimension, finding in particular some cases where thermal and spectral dimension agree, but also some cases where the spectral dimension has puzzling properties while the thermal dimension gives a different and meaningful picture.}},

abstract = {{General Relativity theory is reviewed following the vierbein field theory approach proposed in 1928 by Einstein. It is based on the vierbein field taken as the "square root" of the metric tensor field. Einstein's vierbein theory is a gauge field theory for gravity; the vierbein field playing the role of a gauge field but not exactly like the vector potential field does in Yang-Mills theory--the correction to the derivative (the covariant derivative) is not proportional to the vierbein field as it would be if gravity were strictly a Yang-Mills theory. Einstein discovered the spin connection in terms of the vierbein fields to take the place of the conventional affine connection. To date, one of the most important applications of the vierbein representation is for the derivation of the correction to a 4-spinor quantum field transported in curved space, yielding the correct form of the covariant derivative. Thus, the vierbein field theory is the most natural way to represent a relativistic quantum field theory in curved space. Using the vierbein field theory, presented is a derivation of the the Einstein equation and then the Dirac equation in curved space. Einstein's original 1928 manuscripts translated into English are included.}},

abstract = {{On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0×10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1σ. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410-180+160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09-0.04+0.03. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36-4+5M⊙ and 29-4+4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62-4+4M⊙, with 3.0-0.5+0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.}},

These models are not complete theories and should not be considered too seriously, but their consistency shows that semiclassical gravity is hard to dismiss on purely theoretical grounds.}},

By doing so, they could deduce three axioms of the NCG Standard Model (i.e. order zero, order one and massless photon) from the single requirement that the extended algebra be associative. However, their approach was only applied to the finite algebra and fails the full model. By taking into account the differential graded structure of the algebra of noncommutative differential forms, we obtain a formulation where the same three axioms are deduced from the associativity of the extended differential graded algebra, but which is now also compatible with the full Standard Model. Finally, we present a Lorentzian version of the noncommutative geometry of the Standard Model and we show that the three axioms still hold if the four-dimensional manifold has a Lorentzian metric.}},

The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view.

For classical G-structures, i.e. reductive G-subbundles of the linear frame bundle, such a decomposition defines an infinitesimal canonical lift. This lift extends to a prolongation Gamma-structure on P. In this general geometric framework the concept of a Lie derivative of spinor fields is reviewed. On specializing to the case of the Kosmann lift, we recover Kosmann's original definition. We also show that in the case of a reductive G-structure one can introduce a "reductive Lie derivative" with respect to a certain class of generalized infinitesimal automorphisms, and, as an interesting by-product, prove a result due to Bourguignon and Gauduchon in a more general manner. Next, we give a new characterization as well as a generalization of the Killing equation, and propose a geometric reinterpretation of Penrose's Lie derivative of "spinor fields".

In the first part, we construct a noncommutative residue for the hypoelliptic calculus on Heisenberg manifolds, that is, for the class of Heisenberg PsiDOs introduced by Beals-Greiner and Taylor. This noncommutative residue appears as the residual trace on integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs induced by the analytic extension of the usual trace to non-integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs. Moreover, it agrees with the integral of the density defined by the logarithmic singularity of the Schwartz kernel of the corresponding Heisenberg PsiDO. In addition, we show that this noncommutative residue provides us with the unique trace up to constant multiple on the algebra of integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs. In the second part, we give some analytic applications of this construction concerning zeta functions of hypoelliptic operators, logarithmic metric estimates for Green kernels of hypoelliptic operators, and the extension of the Dixmier trace to the whole algebra of integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs. In the third part, we present examples of computations of noncommutative residues of some powers of the horizontal sublaplacian and the contact Laplacian on contact manifolds. In the fourth part, we present two applications in CR geometry. First, we give some examples of geometric computations of noncommutative residues of some powers of the horizontal sublaplacian and of the Kohn Laplacian. Second, we make use of the framework of noncommutative geometry and of our noncommutative residue to define lower dimensional volumes in pseudohermitian geometry, e.g., we can give sense to the area of any 3-dimensional CR manifold. On the way we obtain a spectral interpretation of the Einstein-Hilbert action in pseudohermitian geometry.}},

In a previous paper, we suggested a reformulation of this framework that is: (i) simpler and more unified in its axioms, and (ii) allows the Lagrangian for the standard model of particle physics (coupled to Einstein gravity) to be specified in a way that is tighter and more explanatory than the traditional algorithm based on effec-tive field theory. Here we explain how this same reformulation yields a new perspective on the symme-tries of a given NCG. Applying this perspective to the NCG traditionally used to describe the standard model we find, instead, an extension of the standard model by an extra − U (1) B L gauge symmetry, and a single extra complex scalar field σ, which is a singlet under × × SU SU U (3) (2) (1) C L Y , but has − = B L 2. This field has cosmological implications, and offers a new solution to the discrepancy between the observed Higgs mass and the NCG prediction.}},

abstract = {{We present a model of (modified) gravity on spacetimes with fractal structure based on packing of spheres, which are (Euclidean) variants of the Packed Swiss Cheese Cosmology models. As the action functional for gravity we consider the spectral action of noncommutative geometry, and we compute its expansion on a space obtained as an Apollonian packing of 3-dimensional spheres inside a 4-dimensional ball. Using information from the zeta function of the Dirac operator of the spectral triple, we compute the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the spectral action. They consist of a zeta regularization of a divergent sum which involves the leading terms of the spectral actions of the individual spheres in the packing. This accounts for the contribution of the points 1 and 3 in the dimension spectrum (as in the case of a 3-sphere). There is an additional term coming from the residue at the additional point in the real dimension spectrum that corresponds to the packing constant, as well as a series of fluctuations coming from log-periodic oscillations, created by the points of the dimension spectrum that are off the real line. These terms detect the fractality of the residue set of the sphere packing. We show that the presence of fractality influences the shape of the slow-roll potential for inflation, obtained from the spectral action. We also discuss the effect of truncating the fractal structure at a certain scale related to the energy scale in the spectral action.}},

The electroweak Higgs connects these branes and is an indispensable part of the geometry. Fermionic would-be zero modes arise at the intersections with two larger branes, leading precisely to the correct chiral matter fields at low energy, along with right-handed neutrinos which can acquire a Majorana mass due to a Higgs singlet. The larger branes give rise to SU(3)\_c, extended by U(1)\_B and another U(1) which are anomalous at low energies and expected to disappear. At higher energies, mirror fermions and additional fields arise, completing the full \{N\}=4 supersymmetry. The brane configuration is a solution of the model, assuming a suitable effective potential and a non-linear stabilization of the singlet Higgs.

Specifically we consider a two-parameter class of twisted Poincaré algebras, from which Lie-algebraic noncommutativities of the translations are derived as well as associative star-products, deformed Riemannian geometries, Lie-algebraic twisted Minkowski spaces, and quantum effects that arise as noncommutativities. Starting from a universal differential algebra of forms based on the above-mentioned Lie-algebraic noncommutativities of the translations, we construct the noncommutative differential forms and inner and outer derivations, which are the noncommutative equivalents of the vector fields in the case of commutative differential geometry. Having established the essentials of this formalism, we construct a bimodule, which is required to be central under the action of the inner derivations in order to have well-defined contractions and from where the algebraic dependence of its coefficients is derived. This again then defines the noncommutative equivalent of the geometrical line-element in commutative differential geometry. We stress, however, that even though the components of the twisted metric are by construction symmetric in their algebra valuation, it is not so for their inverse, and thus to construct it, we made use of Gel’fand’s theory of quasi-determinants, which is conceptually straightforward but computationally quite complicated beyond an algebra of 3 generators. The consequences of the noncommutativity of the Lie-algebra twisted geometry are further discussed.}},

We present some simple constructions of rigid half-BPS surface operators and attempt to determine how they transform under duality.

This is possible because it can be defined not only on smooth geometries but also on discrete (e.g., simplicial) ones. In this paper, we consider the spectral dimension of quantum states of spatial geometry defined on combinatorial complexes endowed with additional algebraic data: the kinematical quantum states of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Preliminarily, the effects of topology and discreteness of classical discrete geometries are studied in a systematic manner. We look for states reproducing the spectral dimension of a classical space in the appropriate regime. We also test the hypothesis that in LQG, as in other approaches, there is a scale dependence of the spectral dimension, which runs from the topological dimension at large scales to a smaller one at short distances. While our results do not give any strong support to this hypothesis, we can however pinpoint when the topological dimension is reproduced by LQG quantum states. Overall, by exploring the interplay of combinatorial, topological and geometrical effects, and by considering various kinds of quantum states such as coherent states and their superpositions, we find that the spectral dimension of discrete quantum geometries is more sensitive to the underlying combinatorial structures than to the details of the additional data associated with them.}},

From these relations one can extract predictions at low energy, giving in particular a Higgs mass around 170 GeV and a top mass compatible with present experimental value.

This requires not only projecting out mirror fermions, as has been done so far, and which leads to the correct Pfaffian, but also the elimination of the remaining extra degrees of freedom. The remaining doubling has to be removed in order to recover the correct Fock space of the physical (Lorentzian) theory. In order to get a spin(1, 3)-invariant Lorentzian theory from a spin(4)-invariant Euclidean theory, such an elimination must be performed after the Wick rotation.

We review the noncommutative spectral geometry, a gravitational model that combines noncommutative geometry with the spectral action principle, in an attempt to unify General Relativity and the Standard Model of electroweak and strong interactions. Despite the phenomenological successes of the model, the discrepancy between the predicted Higgs mass and the current experimental data indicate that one may have to go beyond the simple model considered at first. We review the current status of the phenomenological consequences and their implications. Since this model lives by construction at high energy scales, namely at the Grand Unified Theories scale, it provides a natural framework to investigate early universe cosmology. We briefly review some of its cosmological consequences. 1. Introduction Given the plethora of precise cosmological and astrophysical data and the measurements obtained by particle physics experiments reaching constantly higher energy scales, we are presently in a position to falsify early universe cosmological models. In return, by comparing the theoretical predictions against current data, we are able to constrain the fundamental theories upon which our cosmological models were based. A fruitful such example is the cosmological model based on Noncommutatitive Geometry [1, 2] and the Spectral Action principle, leading to the Noncommutative Spectral Geometry (NCSG), a theoretical framework that can provide [3] a purely geometric explanation for the Standard Model (SM) of strong and electroweak interactions. This model lives by construction in high energy scales, the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) scale, offering a natural framework to study early universe cosmology [4]-[11]. Hence, instead of postulating a Lagrangian upon which we will build our cosmological model, we will adopt the one dictated by NCSG, with the constraints imposed by NCSG itself, and within the framework of this gravitational theory we will address some cosmological issues. Clearly, this is a solid approach, since the cosmological model is inspired and controlled from a fundamental theory. In return, by comparing the predictions of the model against high energy physics measurements and cosmological data, we will be able to constrain some of the free parameters of NCSG and/or its basic element, namely the choice of the algebra. In this presentation, we will first briefly review [12] some elements of NCSG and then discuss some cosmological consequences of the model. Our purpose is not to give a full and detailed analysis, but rather highlight some results and open questions and guide the reader through this powerful interplay between mathematics, high energy physics, cosmology and astrophysics 1 .}},

Ear-lier I provided a general precise setting for understanding such statements, in which the matrix algebras are viewed as quan-tum metric spaces, and convergence is with respect to a quantum Gromov-Hausdorff-type distance. But physicists want even more to treat structures on spheres (and other spaces), such as vector bundles, Yang-Mills function-als, Dirac operators, etc., and they want to approximate these by corresponding structures on matrix algebras. In the present paper we treat this idea for vector bundles. We develop a general pre-cise way for understanding how, for two compact quantum metric spaces that are close together, to a given vector bundle on one of them there can correspond in a natural way a unique vector bundle on the other. We then show explicitly how this works for the case of matrix algebras converging to the 2-sphere.}},

Employing a Dirac type operator on the configuration space of Ashtekar connections we obtain a semi-classical state and a kinematical Hilbert space via its GNS construction. We use the Dirac type operator, which provides a metric structure over the space of Ashtekar connections, to define a scalar curvature operator, from which we obtain a candidate for a Hamilton operator. We show that the classical Hamilton constraint of general relativity emerges from this in a semi-classical limit and we then compute the operator constraint algebra. Also, we find states in the kinematical Hilbert space on which the expectation value of the Dirac type operator gives the Dirac Hamiltonian in a semi-classical limit and thus provides a connection to fermionic quantum field theory. Finally, an almost-commutative algebra emerges from the holonomy-diffeomorphism algebra in the same limit.}},

abstract = {{Close to the Planck energy scale, the quantum nature of space-time reveals itself and all forces, including gravity, should be unified so that all interactions correspond to just one underlying sym-metry. In the absence of a full quantum gravity theory, one may follow an effective approach and consider space-time as the product of a four-dimensional continuum compact Riemanian man-ifold by a tiny discrete finite noncommutative space. Since all available data are of a spectral nature, one may argue that it is more appropriate to apply the spectral action principle in this al-most commutative space. Following this procedure one obtains an elegant geometric explanation for the most successful particle physics model, namely the standard model (and supersymmetric extensions) of electroweak and strong interactions in all its details, as determined by experimental data. Moreover, since this gravitational theory lives by construction at very high energy scales, it offers a perfect framework to address some of the early universe cosmological questions still awaiting for an answer. After introducing some of the main mathematical elements of noncommutative spectral geometry, I will discuss various cosmological and phenomenological consequences of this theory, focusing in particular on constraints imposed on the gravitational sector of the theory.}},

For this reason we start in this chapter with tensor algebra and the representation of tensors in arbitrary coordinate systems, before we elaborate on continuum theory any further. As the emphasis in this book is on practical mathematics, the preferred way of writing tensors will be in index notation. However, many textbooks and the scientific literature use symbolic notation instead. Therefore we will always present both, although at the expense of mathematical stringency.}},

Together with a Hamiltonian this NC algebra generates the generalized fluid dynamics that satisfies exact local conservation laws for mass and energy thereby maintaining mass and energy conservation. However, nontrivial NC correction terms appear in charge and energy fluxes. Other non-relativistic spacetime symmetries of the NC fluid are also discussed in detail. This constitutes the study of kinematics and dynamics of NC fluid.

The main thrust is to verify that the corresponding metric topologies on the state space agree with the weak- * topology. Connes [C1, C2, C3] has shown us that Riemannian metrics on non-commutative spaces (C * -algebras) can be specified by generalized Dirac operators. Although in this setting there is no underlying manifold on which one then obtains an ordinary metric, Connes has shown that one does obtain in a simple way an ordinary metric on the state space of the C * -algebra, generalizing the Monge-Kantorovich metric on probability measures [Ra] (called the " Hutchinson metric " in the theory of fractals [Ba]). But an aspect of this matter which has not received much attention so far [P] is the question of when the metric topology (that is, the topology from the metric coming from a Dirac operator) agrees with the underlying weak- * topology on the state space. Note that for locally compact spaces their topology agrees with the weak- * topology coming from viewing points as linear functionals (by evaluation) on the algebra of continuous functions vanishing at infinity.}},

abstract = {{Let G be a real non-compact reductive Lie group and L a compact sub-group. Take a maximal compact subgroup of \$G\$ containing \$L\$, and suppose that \$G/L\$ is a Riemannian via a bi-invariant metric and that there is a spin structure. Then there is the Dirac operator over \$G/L\$, on spinors with values in a unitary vector bundle. D is a first order, G-invariant, elliptic, essential self-adjoint differential operator.
It has been shown by R. Parthasarathy that with G semi-simple, rank K = rank G, 'discrete-series' representations of G can be realized geometrically on, the kernel of 0 (i.e. the L2-solutions of Of = 0). Following this, we are interested in how the kernel of 0 decomposes into irreducible representations of G, when L is any compact subgroup. In future work we expect to reduce this problem to the compact case i.e. to considering the Dirac operator on K/L Therefore, in this Thesis, we consider the Dirac operator on a compact, Riemannian, spin homogeneous space K/L. And determine the decomposition of the kernel into irreducible representations of K • We consider the tensor product of an induced representation and a finite-, dimensional representation, and apply 'inducing in stages' to the Dirac operator.}},

This structure introduces a notion of global time in noncommutative geometry. As an example, we construct a temporal Lorentzian spectral triple over a Moyal--Minkowski spacetime.

Using such an extension, it is possible to define a Lorentzian distance formula between pure states with a well-defined noncommutative formulation.}},

This could provide an interpretation of the presence of such algebras in P T -symmetric Hamiltonians or the description of topological matter. This construction is used to build an indefinite (i.e. pseudo-Riemannian) version of the spectral triples of noncom-mutative geometry, defined over Krein spaces instead of Hilbert spaces.

What about actions from groupoids, or inductive limits of groups? We establish a general result addressing all these matters. Our result provides a first example of a structure which passes to the limit of quantum metric spaces for the propinquity, as well as a new method to construct group actions, including from non-locally compact groups seen as inductive limits of compact groups, on unital C*-algebras.

A new tensorial notation is developed to present the various constructs of noncommutative geometry. In particular, this notation is used to determine the spectral data of the standard model. The particle spectrum with all of its symmetries is derived, almost uniquely, under the assumption of irreducibility and of dimension 6 modulo 8 for the finite space. The reduction from the natural symmetry group SU(2) × SU(2) × SU(4) to U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) is a consequence of the hypothesis that the two layers of space-time are finite distance apart but is non-dynamical. The square of the Dirac operator, and all geometrical invariants that appear in the calculation of the heat kernel expansion are evaluated. We re-derive the leading order terms in the spectral action. The geometrical action yields unification of all fundamental interactions including gravity at very high energies. We make the following predictions: (i) The number of fermions per family is 16. (ii) The symmetry group is U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3). (iii) There are quarks and leptons in the correct representations. (iv) There is a doublet Higgs that breaks the electroweak symmetry to U(1). (v) Top quark mass of 170–175 GeV. (v) There is a right-handed neutrino with a see-saw mechanism. Moreover, the zeroth order spectral action obtained with a cut-off function is consistent with experimental data up to few percent. We discuss a number of open issues. We prepare the ground for computing higher order corrections since the predicted mass of the Higgs field is quite sensitive to the higher order corrections. We speculate on the nature of the noncommutative space at Planckian energies and the possible role of the fundamental group for the problem of generations.}},

Both theories have transformed our view of physical phenomena, with QM accurately predicting the results of experiments taking place at small length scales, and GR correctly describing observations at larger length scales. However, despite the impressive predictive power of each theory in their respective regimes, their unification still remains unresolved. Theories and proposals for their unification exist but we are lacking experimental guidance towards the true unifying theory. Probing GR at small length scales where quantum effects become relevant is particularly problematic but recently there has been a growing interest in probing the opposite regime, QM at large scales where relativistic effects are important. This is principally because experimental techniques in quantum physics have developed rapidly in recent years with the promise of quantum technologies. Here we review recent advances in experimental and theoretical work on quantum experiments that will be able to probe relativistic effects of gravity on quantum properties. In particular, we emphasise the importance of using the framework of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (QFTCS) in describing these experiments. For example, recent theoretical work using QFTCS has illustrated that these quantum experiments could also be used to enhance measurements of gravitational effects, such as Gravitational Waves (GWs). Verification of such enhancements, as well as other QFTCS predictions in quantum experiments, would provide the first direct validation of this limiting case of quantum gravity.}},

We show that the invariant is related to a certain 4-equivalence which lends it an interpretation as an obstruction to a block decomposition of the sewing matrix up to nonequivariant homotopy. We prove a Mayer-Vietoris Theorem for manifolds with \$\textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\_2\$-actions which intertwines Real and \$\textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\_2\$-equivariant de Rham cohomology groups, and apply it to derive a new localisation formula for the Kane-Mele invariant. This provides a unified cohomological explanation for the equivalence between the discrete Pfaffian formula and the known local geometric computations of the index for periodic lattice systems. We build on the relation between the Kane-Mele invariant and the theory of bundle gerbes with \$\textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\_2\$-actions to obtain geometric refinements of this obstruction and localisation technique. In the preliminary part we review the Freed-Moore theory of band insulators on Galilean spacetimes with emphasis on geometric constructions, and present a bottom-up approach to time-reversal symmetric topological phases.}},

The functional equation gives a duality between the coefficients in positive dimension, which govern the high energy expansion, and the coefficients in negative dimension, exchanging even dimension with odd dimension.}},

abstract = {{In this paper we extend the traditional framework of noncommutative geometry in order to deal with spectral truncations of geometric spaces (i.e. imposing an ultraviolet cutoff in momentum space) and with tolerance relations which provide a coarse grain approximation of geometric spaces at a finite resolution. In our new approach the traditional role played by \$C\textasciicircum*\$-algebras is taken over by operator systems. As part of the techniques we treat \$C\textasciicircum*\$-envelopes, dual operator systems and stable equivalence. We define a propagation number for operator systems, which we show to be an invariant under stable equivalence and use to compare approximations of the same space. We illustrate our methods for concrete examples obtained by spectral truncations of the circle. These are operator systems of finite-dimensional Toeplitz matrices and their dual operator systems which are given by functions in the group algebra on the integers with support in a fixed interval. It turns out that the cones of positive elements and the pure state spaces for these operator systems possess a very rich structure which we analyze including for the algebraic geometry of the boundary of the positive cone and the metric aspect i.e. the distance on the state space associated to the Dirac operator. The main property of the spectral truncation is that it keeps the isometry group intact. In contrast, if one considers the other finite approximation provided by circulant matrices the isometry group becomes discrete, even though in this case the operator system is a \$C\textasciicircum*\$-algebra. We analyze this in the context of the finite Fourier transform. The extension of noncommutative geometry to operator systems allows one to deal with metric spaces up to finite resolution by considering the relation \$d(x,y)<\textbackslashepsilon\$ between two points, or more generally a tolerance relation which naturally gives rise to an operator system.}},

We work in the framework of noncommutative geometry, and focus on the Connes distance associated to a spectral triple (A,H,D). A high momentum (short distance) cut-off is implemented by the action of a projection P on the Dirac operator D and/or on the algebra A. This action induces two new distances. We individuate conditions making them equivalent to the original distance. We also study the Gromov–Hausdorff limit of the set of truncated states, first for compact quantum metric spaces in the sense of Rieffel, then for arbitrary spectral triples. To this aim, we introduce a notion of “state with finite moment of order 1” for noncommutative algebras. We then focus on the commutative case, and show that the cut-off induces a minimal length between points, which is infinite if P has finite rank. When P is a spectral projection of D, we work out an approximation of points by non-pure states that are at finite distance from each other. On the circle, such approximations are given by Fejér probability distributions. Finally we apply the results to the Moyal plane and the fuzzy sphere, obtained as Berezin quantization of the plane and the sphere respectively.}},

The approach is built around a *-algebra generated by local holonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-manifold and a quantized Dirac-type operator, the two capturing the kinematics of quantum gravity formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables. We prove that the separable part of the spectrum of the algebra is contained in the space of measurable connections modulo gauge transformations and we give limitations to the non-separable part. The construction of the Dirac-type operator—and thus the application of noncommutative geometry—is motivated by the requirement of diffeomorphism invariance. We conjecture that a semi-finite spectral triple, which is invariant under volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, arises from a GNS construction of a semi-classical state. Key elements of quantum field theory emerge from the construction in a semi-classical limit, as does an almost commutative algebra. Finally, we note that the spectrum of loop quantum gravity emerges from a discretization of our construction. Certain convergence issues are left unresolved. This paper is the first of two where the second paper [1] is concerned with mathematical details and proofs concerning the spectrum of the holonomy-diffeomorphism algebra.}},

This formulation is consistent with neutrino oscillation experiments and the known bounds of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix (PMNS matrix). But future experiments which may be able to detect neutrino masses directly and high-precision measurements of the PMNS matrix might need massive neutrinos in all three generations. In this paper we present an almost-commutative geometry which allows for a standard model with massive neutrinos in all three generations. This model does not follow in a straightforward way from the version of Chamseddine and Connes since it requires an internal algebra with four summands of matrix algebras, instead of three summands for the model with one massless neutrino.}},

abstract = {{In contrast to the usual Lipschitz seminorms associated to ordinary metrics on compact spaces, we show by examples that Lipschitz seminorms on possibly non-commutative compact spaces are usually not determined by the restriction of the metric they define on the state space, to the extreme points of the state space. We characterize the Lipschitz norms which are determined by their metric on the whole state space as being those which are lower semicontinuous. We show that their domain of Lipschitz elements can be enlarged so as to form a dual Banach space, which generalizes the situation for ordinary Lipschitz seminorms. We give a characterization of the metrics on state spaces which come from Lipschitz semi-norms. The natural (broader) setting for these results is provided by the " function spaces " of Kadison. A variety of methods for constructing Lipschitz seminorms is indicated. In non-commutative geometry (based on C * -algebras), the natural way to specify a metric is by means of a suitable " Lipschitz seminorm " . This idea was first suggested by Connes [C1] and developed further in [C2, C3]. Connes pointed out [C1, C2] that from a Lipschitz seminorm one obtains in a simple way an ordinary metric on the state space of the C * -algebra. This metric generalizes the Monge–Kantorovich metric on probability measures [KA, Ra, RR]. In this article we make more precise the relationship between metrics on the state space and Lipschitz seminorms. Let ρ be an ordinary metric on a compact space X. The Lipschitz seminorm, L ρ , determined by ρ is defined on functions f on X by (0.1) L ρ (f) = sup\{|f (x) − f (y)|/ρ(x, y) : x = y\}.}},

An elementary discussion of the differential geometric and bundle theoretic aspects of G/H, including its projective modules and complex, Kähler and Riemannian structures, is presented for this purpose. An attractive feature of our approach is that it transparently shows obstructions to spin- and spin c -structures. When a manifold is spin c and not spin, U(1) gauge fields have to be introduced in a particular way to define spinors, as shown by Avis, Isham, Cahen, and Gutt. Likewise, for manifolds like SU(3)/SO(3), which are not even spin c , we show that SU(2) and higher rank gauge fields have to be introduced to define spinors. This result has potential consequences for string theories if such manifolds occur as D -branes. The spectra and eigenstates of the Dirac operator on spheres S n = SO (n+1)/ SO (n), invariant under SO (n+1), are explicitly found.

abstract = {{Although topological Anderson insulator has been predicted in 2009, the lasting investigations of this disorder established nontrivial state results in only two experimental observations in cold atoms [Science, \{\textbackslashbf 362 \},929 (2018)] and in photonic crystals [Nature, \{\textbackslashbf 560\}, 461 (2018)] recently. In this paper, we study the topological Anderson transition in electric circuits. By arranging capacitor and inductor network, we construct a disordered Haldane model. Specially, the disorder is introduced by the grounding inductors with random inductance. Based on non-commutative geometry method and transport calculation, we confirm that the disorder in circuits can drive a transition from normal insulator to topological Anderson insulator. We also find the random inductance induced disorder possessing unique characters rather than Anderson disorder, therefore it leads to distinguishable features of topological Anderson transition in circuits. Different from other systems, the topological Anderson insulator in circuits can be detected by measuring the corresponding quantized transmission coefficient and edge state wavefunction due to mature microelectronic technology.}},

It is shown that these structures, i.e. reductive G-subbundles P of Q, admit a canonical decomposition of the pull-back vector bundle iP∗(TQ)≡P×QTQ over P. For classical G-structures, i.e. reductive G-subbundles of the linear frame bundle, such a decomposition defines an infinitesimal canonical lift. This lift extends to a prolongation Γ-structure on P. In this general geometric framework the theory of Lie derivatives is considered. Particular emphasis is given to the morphisms which must be taken in order to state what kind of Lie derivative has to be chosen. On specializing the general theory of gauge-natural Lie derivatives of spinor fields to the case of the Kosmann lift, we recover the result originally found by Kosmann. We also show that in the case of a reductive G-structure one can introduce a “reductive Lie derivative” with respect to a certain class of generalized infinitesimal automorphisms. This differs, in general, from the gauge-natural one, and we conclude by showing that the “metric Lie derivative” introduced by Bourguignon and Gauduchon is in fact a particular kind of reductive rather than gauge-natural Lie derivative.}},

The commutation relation between the Dirac operator and the algebra has a structure related to the Poisson bracket of general relativity. Moreover, the associated Hilbert space corresponds, up to a certain symmetry group, to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism-invariant states known from loop quantum gravity. Correspondingly, the square of the Dirac operator has, in terms of loop quantum gravity, the form of a global area-squared operator. Furthermore, the spectral action functional resembles a partition function of quantum gravity. The construction is background independent and is based on an inductive system of triangulations.

abstract = {{Symmetries in the Physical Laws of Nature lead to observable effects. Beyond the regularities and conserved magnitudes, the last few decades in particle physics have seen the identification of symmetries, and their well-defined breaking, as the guiding principle for the elementary constituents of matter and their interactions. Flavour SU(3) symmetry of hadrons led to the Quark Model and the antisymmetric requirement under exchange of identical fermions led to the colour degree of freedom. Colour became the generating charge for flavour-independent strong interactions of quarks and gluons in the exact colour SU(3) local gauge symmetry. Parity Violation in weak interactions led us to consider the chiral fields of fermions as the objects with definite transformation properties under the weak isospin SU(2) gauge group of the Unifying Electro-Weak SU(2) × U(1) symmetry, which predicted novel weak neutral current interactions. CP-Violation led to three families of quarks opening the field of Flavour Physics. Time-reversal violation has recently been observed with entangled neutral mesons, compatible with CPT-invariance. The cancellation of gauge anomalies, which would invalidate the gauge symmetry of the quantum field theory, led to Quark–Lepton Symmetry. Neutrinos were postulated in order to save the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum in nuclear beta decay. After the ups and downs of their mass, neutrino oscillations were discovered in 1998, opening a new era about their origin of mass, mixing, discrete symmetries and the possibility of global lepton-number violation through Majorana mass terms and Leptogenesis as the source of the matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The experimental discovery of quarks and leptons and the mediators of their interactions, with physical observables in spectacular agreement with this Standard Theory, is the triumph of Symmetries. The gauge symmetry is exact only when the particles are massless. One needs a subtle breaking of the symmetry, providing the origin of mass without affecting the excellent description of the interactions. This is the Brout–Englert–Higgs Mechanism, which produces the Higgs Boson as a remnant, discovered at CERN in 2012. Open present problems are addressed with by searching the New Physics Beyond-the-Standard-Model.}},

The idea, in brief, is to represent A (the algebra of differential forms on some possibly-noncommutative space) on H (the Hilbert space of spinors on that space); and to reinterpret this representation as a simple super-algebra B = A ⊕ H with even part A and odd part H. B is the fundamental object in our approach: we show that (nearly) all of the basic axioms and assumptions of the traditional real-spectral-triple formalism of NCG are elegantly recovered from the simple requirement that B should be a differential graded ∗-algebra (or “∗-DGA”). Moreover, this requirement also yields other, new, geometrical constraints. When we apply our formalism to the NCG traditionally used to describe the standard model of particle physics, we find that these new constraints are physically meaningful and phenomenologically correct. In particular, these new constraints provide a novel interpretation of electroweak symmetry breaking that is geometric rather than dynamical. This formalism is more restrictive than effective field theory, and so explains more about the observed structure of the standard model, and offers more guidance about physics beyond the standard model.}},

This condition quantizes the frequency of radiation that can be absorbed or emitted by a black hole. If this quantization applies to the "ring down" gravitational radiation emitted immediately after a black hole merger, a single measurement consistent with the predictions of classical general relativity would rule out most or all (depending on the spin of the hole) of the extant proposals in the literature for the value of \$\textbackslashalpha\$. A measurement of two such events for final black holes with substantially different spins would rule out the proposal for any \$\textbackslashalpha\$. If the modification of general relativity is confined to the near-horizon region within the hole's light ring and does not affect the initial ring down signal, a detection of "echoes" with characteristic properties could still confirm the proposal.}},

We define a natural symplectic structure over this phase space and construct the corresponding quantum theory using a covariant canonical quantization approach. We show that the Connes distance between certain two states over the algebra A (two ``spacetime points''), which is an arbitrary positive number in the classical noncommutative geometry, turns out to be discrete in the quantum theory, and we compute its spectrum. The quantum states of the noncommutative geometry form a Hilbert space K. D is promoted to an operator *D on the direct product *H of H and K.

abstract = {{We revise and extend the algorithm provided in [1] to compute the finite Connes' distance between normal states. The original formula in [1] contains an error and actually only provides a lower bound. The correct expression, which we provide here, involves the computation of the infimum of an expression which involves the "transverse" component of the algebra element in addition to the "longitudinal" component of [1]. This renders the formula less user-friendly, as the determination of the exact transverse component for which the infimum is reached remains a non-trivial task, but under rather generic conditions it turns out that the Connes' distance is proportional to the trace norm of the difference in the density matrices, leading to considerable simplification. In addition, we can determine an upper bound of the distance by emulating and adapting the approach of [2] in our Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation. We then look for an optimal element for which the upper bound is reached. We are able to find one for the Moyal plane through the limit of a sequence obtained by finite dimensional projections of the representative of an element belonging to a multiplier algebra, onto the subspaces of the total Hilbert space, occurring in the spectral triple and spanned by the eigen-spinors of the respective Dirac operator. This is in contrast with the fuzzy sphere, where the upper bound, which is given by the geodesic of a commutative sphere is never reached for any finite \$n\$-representation of \$SU(2)\$. Indeed, for the case of maximal non-commutativity (\$n = 1/2\$), the finite distance is shown to coincide exactly with the above mentioned lower bound, with the transverse component playing no role. This, however starts changing from \$n=1\$ onwards and we try to improve the estimate of the finite distance and provide an almost exact result, using our new and modified algorithm.}},

This is used to calcu­late the determinant ∆ for the hyperbola billiard over a range which includes 46 quantum energy levels. The result is compared with semiclassical periodic orbit evaluations of ∆ using the Dirichlet series, Euler product, and a Riemann-Siegel-type formula. It is found that the Riemann-Siegel-type expansion, which uses the least number of orbits, gives the closest approximation. This provides explicit numerical support for recent conjectures concerning the analytic proper­ties of semiclassical formulae, and in particular for the existence of resummation relations connecting long and short pseudo-orbits.}},

This is shown to be true in general for collapsing circle bundles with totally geodesic fibers. Using the Hopf fibration we use this fact to compute the Dirac eigenvalues on complex projective space including the multiplicities. Finally, we show that there are 1-parameter families of Riemannian nilmanifolds such that the Laplacian on functions and the Dirac operator for certain spin structures have constant spectrum while the Laplacian on 1-forms and the Dirac operator for the other spin structures have nonconstant spectrum. The marked length spectrum is also constant for these families.}},

abstract = {{A fuzzy geometry is a certain type of finite-dimensional spectral triple whose Dirac operator crucially turns out to be a (finite) matrix. In the framework of random noncommutatative geometry, we use Barrett's characterization of Dirac operators of fuzzy geometries in order to systematically compute the spectral action \$S(D)= \textbackslashmathrm\{Tr\} f(D)\$ for \$2n\$-dimensional fuzzy geometries. In contrast to the original Chamseddine-Connes spectral action, we take a polynomial \$f\$ with \$f(x)\textbackslashto \textbackslashinfty\$ as \$ |x|\textbackslashto\textbackslashinfty\$ in order to obtain a well-defined path integral that can be stated as a random matrix model with action of the type \$S(D)=N \textbackslashcdot \textbackslashmathrm\{tr\}\textbackslash, F+\textbackslashtextstyle\textbackslashsum\_i \textbackslashmathrm\{tr\}\textbackslash,A\_i \textbackslashcdot \textbackslashmathrm\{tr\} \textbackslash,B\_i \$, being \$F,A\_i \$ and \$B\_i \$ noncommutative polynomials in \$2\textasciicircum\{2n-1\}\$ complex \$N\textbackslashtimes N\$ matrices that parametrize the Dirac operator \$D\$. For arbitrary signature---thus for arbitrary admissible KO-dimension---formulas for 2-dimensional fuzzy geometries are given up to a sextic polynomial, and up to a quartic polynomial for 4-dimensional ones, with focus on the octo-matrix models for Lorentzian and Riemannian signatures. The noncommutatative polynomials \$F,A\_i \$ and \$B\_i\$ are obtained via chord diagrams and satisfy: independence of \$N\$; self-adjointness of the main polynomial \$F\$ (modulo cyclic reordering of each monomial); also up to cyclicity, either self-adjointness or anti-self-adjointness of \$A\_i \$ and \$B\_i \$ simultaneously, for fixed \$i\$. Collectively, this favors a free probabilistic perspective for the large-\$N\$ limit we elaborate on.}},

abstract = {{The system of strongly interacting particles is discussed, with electromagnetism, weak interactions, and gravitation considered as perturbations. The electric current jα, the weak current Jα, and the gravitational tensor θαβ are all well-defined operators, with finite matrix elements obeying dispersion relations. To the extent that the dispersion relations for matrix elements of these operators between the vacuum and other states are highly convergent and dominated by contributions from intermediate one-meson states, we have relations like the Goldberger-Treiman formula and universality principles like that of Sakurai according to which the ρ meson is coupled approximately to the isotopic spin. Homogeneous linear dispersion relations, even without subtractions, do not suffice to fix the scale of these matrix elements; in particular, for the nonconserved currents, the renormalization factors cannot be calculated, and the universality of strength of the weak interactions is undefined. More information than just the dispersion relations must be supplied, for example, by field-theoretic models; we consider, in fact, the equal-time commutation relations of the various parts of j4 and J4. These nonlinear relations define an algebraic system (or a group) that underlies the structure of baryons and mesons. It is suggested that the group is in fact U(3)×U(3), exemplified by the symmetrical Sakata model. The Hamiltonian density θ44 is not completely invariant under the group; the noninvariant part transforms according to a particular representation of the group; it is possible that this information also is given correctly by the symmetrical Sakata model. Various exact relations among form factors follow from the algebraic structure. In addition, it may be worthwhile to consider the approximate situation in which the strangeness-changing vector currents are conserved and the Hamiltonian is invariant under U(3); we refer to this limiting case as "unitary symmetry." In the limit, the baryons and mesons form degenerate supermultiplets, which break up into isotopic multiplets when the symmetry-breaking term in the Hamiltonian is "turned on." The mesons are expected to form unitary singlets and octets; each octet breaks up into a triplet, a singlet, and a pair of strange doublets. The known pseudoscalar and vector mesons fit this pattern if there exists also an isotopic singlet pseudoscalar meson χ0. If we consider unitary symmetry in the abstract rather than in connection with a field theory, then we find, as an attractive alternative to the Sakata model, the scheme of Ne'eman and Gell-Mann, which we call the "eightfold way"; the baryons N, Λ, Σ, and Ξ form an octet, like the vector and pseudoscalar meson octets, in the limit of unitary symmetry. Although the violations of unitary symmetry must be quite large, there is some hope of relating certain violations to others. As an example of the methods advocated, we present a rough calculation of the rate of K+→μ++ν in terms of that of π+→μ++ν.}},

For these other connections we give a criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for their Dirac operator to be formally self-adjoint. We hope to use the detailed results given here to clarify statements in the literature of high-eneregy physics concerning "Dirac operators" for matrix algebras that converge to coadjoint orbits. To facilitate this we employ here only global methods – we never use local coordinate charts, and we use the cross-section modules of vector bundles.}},

In the one-sided case it implies that the manifold decomposes into a disconnected sum of spheres which will represent quanta of geometry. The two sided version in dimension 4 predicts the two algebras M2(ℍ) and M4(ℂ) which are the algebraic constituents of the Standard Model of particle physics. This taken together with the non-commutative algebra of functions allows one to reconstruct, using the spectral action, the Lagrangian of gravity coupled with the Standard Model. We show that any connected Riemannian Spin 4-manifold with quantized volume > 4 (in suitable units) appears as an irreducible representation of the two-sided commutation relations in dimension 4 and that these representations give a seductive model of the “particle picture” for a theory of quantum gravity in which both the Einstein geometric standpoint and the Standard Model emerge from Quantum Mechanics.

More specifically, we study: (1) noncommutative geometry deviations and (2) ungraviton corrections. As a special result in the noncommutative case, we find that the noncommutative character of the manifold would be equivalent to the temperature of a thermodynamic system. Therefore, in analogy to the zero temperature configuration, the description of spacetime in terms of a differential manifold could be obtained only asymptotically. Finally, we extend the Verlinde's derivation to a general case, which includes all possible effects, noncommutativity, ungravity, asymptotically safe gravity, electrostatic energy, and extra dimensions, showing that the procedure is solid versus such modifications.}},

abstract = {{The focus of this PhD thesis is on applications, new developments and extensions of the noncommutative gravity theory proposed by Julius Wess and his group. In part one we propose an extension of the usual symmetry reduction procedure to noncommutative gravity. We classify in the case of abelian Drinfel'd twists all consistent deformations of spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies and of the Schwarzschild black hole. The deformed symmetry structure allows us to obtain exact solutions of the noncommutative Einstein equations in many of our models. In part two we develop a new formalism for quantum field theory on noncommutative curved spacetimes by combining methods from the algebraic approach to quantum field theory with noncommutative differential geometry. We also study explicit examples of deformed wave operators and find that there can be noncommutative corrections even on the level of free field theories. The convergent deformation of simple toy models is investigated and it is found that these theories have an improved behaviour at short distances, i.e. in the ultraviolet. In part three we study homomorphisms between and connections on noncommutative vector bundles. We prove that all homomorphisms and connections of the deformed theory can be obtained by applying a quantization isomorphism to undeformed homomorphisms and connections. The extension of homomorphisms and connections to tensor products of bimodules is clarified. As a nontrivial application of the new mathematical formalism we extend our studies of exact noncommutative gravity solutions to more general deformations.}},

This regularisation usually is a discretisation, which makes it necessary to give up some paradigms or symmetries of continuum physics. Causal dynamical triangulations regularises the path integral through a simplicial discretisation that introduces a preferred time foliation. The first part of this thesis presents three articles on causal dynamical triangulations. The first article shows how to obtain a multicritical 2d model by coupling the theory to hard dimers. The second explores the connection to Ho\textbackslashv\{r\}ava-Lifshitz gravity that is suggested by the time foliation and establishes that in 2d the theories are equivalent. The last article does not directly concern causal dynamical triangulations but Euclidian dynamical triangulations with an additional measure term, which are examined to understand whether they contain an extended phase without the need for a preferred time foliation. Causal set theory uses an explicitly Lorentz invariant discretisation, which introduces non-local effects. The second part of this thesis presents two articles in causal set theory. The first explicitly calculates closed form expressions for the d'Alembertian operator in any dimension, which can be implemented in computer simulations. The second develops a ruler to examine the manifoldlikeness of small regions in a causal set, and can be used to recover locality.}},

It is usually challenging to obtain analytical expressions for it because most calculation methods rely on the diagonalization of the density matrix. In this paper, we derive general expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix that bypass matrix diagonalization and do not require the expansion of operators on an orthonormal set of states. Additionally, we can tackle density matrices of arbitrary rank. The methods presented here simplify analytical calculations considerably when, for example, the density matrix is more naturally expressed in terms of nonorthogonal states, such as coherent states. Our derivation relies on two matrix inverses that, in principle, can be evaluated analytically even when the density matrix is not diagonalizable in closed form. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving novel results in the timely field of discrete quantum imaging: the estimation of positions and intensities of incoherent point sources. We find analytical expressions for the full estimation problem of two point sources with different intensities and for specific examples with three point sources. We expect that our method will become standard in quantum metrology.}},

abstract = {{We review a novel and authentic way to quantize gravity. This novel approach is based on the fact that Einstein gravity can be formulated in terms of a symplectic geometry rather than a Riemannian geometry in the context of emergent gravity. An essential step for emergent gravity is to realize the equivalence principle, the most important property in the theory of gravity (general relativity), from U(1) gauge theory on a symplectic or Poisson manifold. Through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an intrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the Moser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from noncommutative U(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the noncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory. As a consequence, a background-independent quantum gravity in which the prior existence of any spacetime structure is not a priori assumed but is defined by using the fundamental ingredients in quantum gravity theory can be formulated. This scheme for quantum gravity can be used to resolve many notorious problems in theoretical physics, such as the cosmological constant problem, to understand the nature of dark energy, and to explain why gravity is so weak compared to other forces. In particular, it leads to a remarkable picture of what matter is. A matter field, such as leptons and quarks, simply arises as a stable localized geometry, which is a topological object in the defining algebra (noncommutative ★-algebra) of quantum gravity.}},

Further to this, the main original results of my Ph.D. thesis were obtained within the framework of local or non-local boundary conditions for the Dirac operator, with application to heat-kernel asymptotics and one-loop quantum cosmology. The problem of boundary conditions in the formulation of physical laws, the interplay of geometric and analytic concepts, and the application of spinorial techniques have always been at the heart of my research since those early days.

With the aim of investigating phase transitions in random NCG of arbitrary dimension, we study the nonperturbative Functional Renormalization Group for multimatrix models whose action consists of noncommutative polynomials in Hermitian and anti-Hermitian matrices. Such structure is dictated by the Spectral Action for the Dirac operator in Barrett’s spectral triple formulation of fuzzy spaces. The present mathematically rigorous treatment puts forward “coordinate-free” language that might be useful also elsewhere, all the more so because our approach holds for general multimatrix models. The toolkit is a noncommutative calculus on the free algebra that allows to describe the generator of the renormalization group flow—a noncommutative Laplacian introduced here—in terms of Voiculescu’s cyclic gradient and Rota–Sagan–Stein noncommutative derivative. We explore the algebraic structure of the Functional Renormalization Group equation and, as an application of this formalism, we find the β-functions, identify the fixed points in the large-N limit and obtain the critical exponents of two-dimensional geometries in two different signatures.}},

We refine this statement by considering topological operators that are not necessarily associated with any global symmetry. For discrete gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, we show that completeness of the spectrum is equivalent to the absence of certain Gukov-Witten topological operators. We further extend our analysis to four and higher spacetime dimensions. Since topological operators are natural generalizations of global symmetries, we discuss evidence for their absence in a consistent theory of quantum gravity.}},

abstract = {{ We present the Mathematica application “LieART” (Lie Algebras and Representation Theory) for computations frequently encountered in Lie algebras and representation theory, such as tensor product decomposition and subalgebra branching of irreducible representations. LieART can handle all classical and exceptional Lie algebras. It computes root systems of Lie algebras, weight systems and several other properties of irreducible representations. LieART’s user interface has been created with a strong focus on usability and thus allows the input of irreducible representations via their dimensional name, while the output is in the textbook style used in most particle-physics publications. The unique Dynkin labels of irreducible representations are used internally and can also be used for input and output. LieART exploits the Weyl reflection group for most of the calculations, resulting in fast computations and a low memory consumption. Extensive tables of properties, tensor products and branching rules of irreducible representations are included as online supplementary material (see Appendix A).

Memory usage depends strongly on the Lie algebra’s rank and type, as well as the dimensionality of the representations in the computation. Classification: 4.2, 11.1. External routines: Wolfram Mathematica 8-10 Nature of problem: The use of Lie algebras and their representations is widespread in physics, especially in particle physics. The description of nature in terms of gauge theories requires the assignment of fields to representations of compact Lie groups and their Lie algebras. Mass and interaction terms in the Lagrangian give rise to the need for computing tensor products of representations of Lie algebras. The mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the application of subalgebra decomposition. This computer code was designed for the purpose of Grand Unified Theory (GUT) Model building, where compact Lie groups beyond the U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) of the Standard Model of particle physics are needed. Tensor product decomposition and subalgebra decomposition have been implemented for all classical Lie groups SU ( N ) , SO ( N ) and Sp ( 2 N ) and the exceptionals E6, E7, E8, F4 and G2. Solution method: LieART generates the weight system of an irreducible representation (irrep) of a Lie algebra by exploiting the Weyl reflection groups, which is inherent in all simple Lie algebras. Tensor products are computed by the application of Klimyk’s formula, except for SU ( N ) ’s, where the Young-tableaux algorithm is used. Subalgebra decomposition of SU ( N ) ’s are performed by projection matrices, which are generated from an algorithm to determine maximal subalgebras as originally developed by Dynkin [1, 2]. Restrictions: Internally irreps are represented by their unique Dynkin label. LieART’s default behavior in TraditionalForm is to print the dimensional name, which is the labeling preferred by physicists. Most Lie algebras can have more than one irrep of the same dimension and different irreps with the same dimension are usually distinguished by one or more primes (e.g. 175 and 175′ of A4). To determine the need for one or more primes of an irrep a brute-force loop over other irreps must be performed to search for irreps with the same dimensionality. Since Lie algebras have an infinite number of irreps, this loop must be cut off, which is done by limiting the maximum Dynkin digit in the loop. In rare cases for irreps of high dimensionality in high-rank algebras, if the cutoff used is too low, then the assignment of primes will be incorrect, but the problem can be avoided by raising the cutoff. However, in either case, this can only affect the display of the irrep because all computations involving this irrep are correct, since the internal unique representation of Dynkin labels is used. Running time: From less than a second to hours depending on the Lie algebra’s rank and type and/or the dimensionality of the representations in the computation. References: [1] E.

abstract = {{The Hofstadter model, well known for its fractal butterfly spectrum, describes two-dimensional electrons under a perpendicular magnetic field, which gives rise to the integer quantum Hall effect. Inspired by the real-space building blocks of non-Abelian gauge fields from a recent experiment, we introduce and theoretically study two non-Abelian generalizations of the Hofstadter model. Each model describes two pairs of Hofstadter butterflies that are spin–orbit coupled. In contrast to the original Hofstadter model that can be equivalently studied in the Landau and symmetric gauges, the corresponding non-Abelian generalizations exhibit distinct spectra due to the non-commutativity of the gauge fields. We derive the genuine (necessary and sufficient) non-Abelian condition for the two models from the commutativity of their arbitrary loop operators. At zero energy, the models are gapless and host Weyl and Dirac points protected by internal and crystalline symmetries. Double (8-fold), triple (12-fold), and quadrupole (16-fold) Dirac points also emerge, especially under equal hopping phases of the non-Abelian potentials. At other fillings, the gapped phases of the models give rise to topological insulators. We conclude by discussing possible schemes for experimental realization of the models on photonic platforms. Modeling the spectral properties of spin-orbit coupled crystals in a magnetic field could lead to new topological phases in matter and lay the foundations for new photonic systems. Synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields have emerged as a new way for studying the topological phases of matter, providing new insights in optics and photonics. However, synthesizing non-Abelian gauge fields has proved very challenging. Now, Yi Yang and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with a researcher from the University of Pennsylvania, have studied two non-Abelian generalisations of the Hofstadter model, which describes the behaviour of two-dimensional non-interacting electrons in a non-Abelian magnetic field. They proved the genuine non-Abelian conditions and analyze the topological properties of the models. The work could lead to a new way of manipulating light in photonic devices.}},

Its central themes, comprising space-time geometry and the general relativistic account of gravity, quantum field theory and the gauge theories of fundamental forces, and statistical mechanics and the theory of phase transitions, are developed in explicit mathematical detail, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding. Straightforward treatments of the standard models of particle physics and cosmology are supplemented with introductory accounts of more speculative theories, including supersymmetry and string theory. This third edition of the Tour includes a new chapter on quantum gravity, focusing on the approach known as Loop Quantum Gravity, while new sections provide extended discussions of topics that have become prominent in recent years, such as the Higgs boson, massive neutrinos, cosmological perturbations, dark energy and matter, and the thermodynamics of black holes. Designed for those in search of a solid grasp of the inner workings of these theories, but who prefer to avoid a full-scale assault on the research literature, the Tour assumes as its point of departure a familiarity with basic undergraduate-level physics, and emphasizes the interconnections between aspects of physics that are more often treated in isolation. The companion website at www.unifiedgrandtours.org provides further resources, including a comprehensive manual of solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises.}},

abstract = {{The group SU (N) has N 2 − 1 generators t a which form the basis of a Lie algebra defined by the commutator relations in (A.2). The group has rank N − 1, so there are N − 1 Casimir operators which commute with all generators and label the irreducible representations of SU (N). A given irreducible representation is then defined by N − 1 numbers. It has dimension D and defines a D-dimensional invariant subspace that can be visualized by collecting its basis states in a multiplet. Rank N − 1 also entails that there are at most N − 1 generators that commute with each other; they form the Cartan subalgebra (the maximal Abelian subalgebra) and label the states within the multiplet. The multiplets are therefore geometric structures in N − 1 dimensions. The remaining generators are ladder operators that connect the states with each other. Here are examples for N = 2, 3 and 4: SU(2): The group SU (2) describes angular momentum (spin, isospin, etc) and has three generators t a (often called J a). It has rank one, so there is one Casimir operator (t a t a = J 2) whose eigenvalues j(j + 1) label the irreducible representations; the spin j can take integer and half-integer values. The Cartan subalgebra consists of only one generator (t 3) whose eigenvalues cover the interval −j . . . j and label the states within each multiplet. Anticipating the notation for SU (3), we denote the irreducible representations of SU (2) by D p , where p = 2j = 0, 1, 2, . . . Their dimension (which we also call D p for brevity) is then D p = p + 1: D 0 = 1 , D 1 = 2 , D 2 = 3 , D 3 = 4 , . . . (C.1)}},

The resulting non- deterministicmotionofphotonsonthe Planck scale isexpected to produce energy-dependent stochastic fluctuations in their speed. Such a stochastic deviation from the well-measured speed of light at low photon energies, c, should be contrasted with the possibility of an energy-dependent systematic, deterministic deviation. Such a systematic deviation, on which observations by the Fermi satellite set Planck-scale limits for linear energy dependence2 , is more easily searched for than stochastic deviations. Here, for the first time,we place Planck- scale limits on the more generic spacetime-foam prediction of energy-dependent fuzziness in the speed of photons. Using high-energy observations fromthe Fermi Large AreaTelescope (LAT) of gamma-ray burst GRB090510, we test a model in which photon speeds are distributed normally around c with a standard deviation proportional to the photon energy. We constrain the model's characteristic energy scale beyond the Planck scale at \textbackslashtextgreater2.8EPl (\textbackslashtextgreater1.6EPl ), at 95\% (99\%) confidence.

All knots and links with up to six crossings, including the Hopf link, the Star of David, and the Borromean rings, are demonstrated, stabilizing colloidal particles into an unusual soft matter. The knots in chiral nematic colloids are classified by the quantized self-linking number, a direct measure of the geometric, or Berry’s, phase.

We point out that the support provided for this claim is only applicable to a very limited class of quantum-classical interaction models, corresponding to Koopman-type dynamics. We show that the claim is also valid for mean-field models, but that it is contradicted by explicit counterexamples based on the configuration-ensemble model.

In this view it is more relevant to find ways to deduce the microscopic ingredients of spacetime and matter from their macroscopic attributes than to find ways to quantize general relativity because it would only give us the equivalent of phonon physics, not the equivalents of atoms or quantum electrodyanmics. It may turn out that spacetime is merely a representation of collective state of matter in some limiting regime of interactions, which is the view expressed by Sakharov. In this talk, working within the conceptual framework of geometro-hydrodynamics, we suggest a new way to look at the nature of spacetime inspired by Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) physics. We ask the question whether spacetime could be a condensate, even without the knowledge of what the `atom of spacetime' is. We begin with a summary of the main themes for this new interpretation of cosmology and spacetime physics, and the `bottom-up' approach to quantum gravity. We then describe the `Bosenova' experiment of controlled collapse of a BEC and our cosmology-inspired interpretation of its results. We discuss the meaning of a condensate in different context. We explore how far this idea can sustain, its advantages and pitfalls, and its implications on the basic tenets of physics and existing programs of quantum gravity.}},

For p and q positive, the quadric Qp,q is orientable iff p + q is even. The quadric has two natural metrics, invariant with respect to the action of O(p + 1) × O(q + 1): a proper Riemannian one and a pseudo-Riemannian metric of signature (p,q). This paper contains an explicit description of spin structures on real, even-dimensional quadrics for both metrics, whenever these structures exist. In particular, it is shown that, for p and q even positive, the proper (pseudo-Riemannian) metric gives rise to two inequivalent spin structures iff p + q ≡ 2 (mod 4) (p + q ≡ 0 (mod 4)). If p and q are odd and > 1, then there is no spin structure for their metric whenever p + q ≡ 0 (mod 4); otherwise, there are two spin structures for each of the metrics.

abstract = {{A finite non-commutative geometry consists of a fuzzy space together with a Dirac operator satisfying the axioms of a real spectral triple. This paper addresses the question of how to extract information about these geometries from the spectrum of the Dirac operator. Since the Dirac operator is a finite-dimensional matrix, the usual asymptotics of the eigenvalues makes no sense and is replaced by measurements of the spectrum at a finite energy scale. The spectral dimension of the square of the Dirac operator is improved to provide a new spectral measure of the dimension of a space called the spectral variance. Similarly, the volume of a space can be computed from the spectrum once the dimension is known. Two methods of doing this are investigated: the well-known Dixmier trace and a recent improvement due to Abel Stern. Finally, the distance between two geometries is investigated by comparing the spectral zeta functions using the method of Cornelissen and Kontogeorgis. All of these techniques are tested on the explicit examples of the fuzzy spheres and fuzzy tori, which can be regarded as approximations of the usual Riemannian sphere and flat tori. Then they are applied to characterise some random fuzzy spaces using data generated by a Monte Carlo simulation.}},

This metric resolves several important issues raised by recent research in noncommutative metric geometry: it makes *-isomorphism a necessary condition for distance zero, it is well-adapted to Leibniz seminorms, and — very importantly — is complete, unlike the quantum propinquity which we introduced earlier. Thus our new metric provides a natural tool for noncommutative metric geometry, designed to allow for the generalizations of techniques from metric geometry to C*-algebra theory. Résumé: Motivés par la quête d'une métrique analogue à la distance de Gromov-Hausdorff pour la géométrie non-commutative et adaptée aux C*-algèbres, nous proposons une distance complète sur la classe des espaces métriques compacts quantiques de Leibniz. Cette nouvelle distance, que nous appelons la proximité duale de Gromov-Hausdorff, résout plusieurs problèmes importants que la recherche courante en géométrie métrique noncommutative a révélés. En particulier, il est nécessaire pour les C*-algèbres d'être isomorphes pour avoir distance zéro, et tous les espaces quantiques compacts impliqués dans le calcul de la proximité duale sont de type Leibniz.

It is proposed to be located in the avian retina, and be mediated by a light-induced, biochemical radical-pair mechanism involving cryptochromes as putative receptor molecules.

We measured gene expression of Cry1, Cry2 and Cry4 in the retina, muscle and brain of zebra finches over the circadian day to assess whether they showed any circadian rhythmicity. We hypothesized that retinal cryptochromes involved in magnetoreception should be expressed at a constant level over the circadian day, because birds use a light-dependent magnetic compass for orientation not only during migration, but also for spatial orientation tasks in their daily life. Cryptochromes serving in circadian tasks, on the other hand, are expected to be expressed in a rhythmic (circadian) pattern. Cry1 and Cry2 displayed a daily variation in the retina as expected for circadian clock genes, while Cry4 expressed at constant levels over time. We conclude that Cry4 is the most likely candidate magnetoreceptor of the light-dependent magnetic compass in birds.}},

These tools depend only on the spectrum of the Dirac operator. Dimensional measures based on Weyl’s law and heat kernel  asymptotics are defined. A new dimensional  measured called the  spectral variance is defined as a modification of the spectral dimension to remove some of its undesirable properties. Volume measures based upon the Dixmier trace and the work of Stern are adapted to the finite setting and tested on the fuzzy spaces.The distance between two geometries is investigated by comparing the spectral zeta functions using the method of Cornelissen and Kontogeorgis. All of these tools are then used to investigate the fuzzy sphere, the fuzzy tori and the random fuzzy spaces introduced by Barrett and Glaser. The role of symmetry in the creation of fuzzy spaces is investigated using the characterisation of the Dirac operator given by Barrett. It is shown that all SU(2)-equivariant Dirac operators for type (0, 3) and (1, 3) fuzzy spaces produce the round metric on the sphere, despite the Dirac operators not agreeing with Grosse-Presnadjer or Barrett operators.  A pathway for further research is presented along these lines.}},

This theory is known to exhibit a phase transition as the analytic continuation parameter β, akin to an inverse temperature, is varied. Using a scaling analysis we find that the asymptotic regime is reached at relatively small values of N. Focussing on the causal set action S, we find that scales like where the scaling exponent ν takes different values on either side of the phase transition. For we find that which is consistent with our analytic predictions for a non-continuum phase in the large β regime. For we find that , consistent with a continuum phase of constant negative curvature thus suggesting a dynamically generated cosmological constant.

Then, all primary objects defined for manifolds will be generalized to reach the level of noncommutative geometry via spectral triples, with the concrete analysis of the noncommutative torus which is a deformation of the ordinary one. The basics of different ingredients will be presented and studied like, Dirac operators, heat equation asymptotics, zeta functions and then, how to get within the framework of operators on Hilbert spaces, the notion of noncommutative residue, Dixmier trace, pseudodifferential operators etc. These notions are appropriate in noncommutative geometry to tackle the case where the space is swapped with an algebra like for instance the noncommutative torus.

Although they have been the subject of considerable theoretical study, their creation in the laboratory has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here we report the creation of isolated trefoil vortex knots and pairs of linked vortex rings in water using a new method of accelerating specially shaped hydrofoils. Using a high-speed scanning tomography apparatus, we measure their three-dimensional topological and geometrical evolution in detail. In both cases we observe that the linked vortices stretch themselves and then deform—as dictated by their geometrically determined energy—towards a series of local vortex reconnections.

abstract = {{The causal set theory (CST) approach to quantum gravity postulates that at the most fundamental level, spacetime is discrete, with the spacetime continuum replaced by locally finite posets or “causal sets”. The partial order on a causal set represents a proto-causality relation while local finiteness encodes an intrinsic discreteness. In the continuum approximation the former corresponds to the spacetime causality relation and the latter to a fundamental spacetime atomicity, so that finite volume regions in the continuum contain only a finite number of causal set elements. CST is deeply rooted in the Lorentzian character of spacetime, where a primary role is played by the causal structure poset. Importantly, the assumption of a fundamental discreteness in CST does not violate local Lorentz invariance in the continuum approximation. On the other hand, the combination of discreteness and Lorentz invariance gives rise to a characteristic non-locality which distinguishes CST from most other approaches to quantum gravity. In this review we give a broad, semi-pedagogical introduction to CST, highlighting key results as well as some of the key open questions. This review is intended both for the beginner student in quantum gravity as well as more seasoned researchers in the field.}},

D1/3 is a symmetric elliptic differential operator, acting on sections of the spinor bundle and can be identified in special cases with Kostant’s cubic Dirac operator or the Dolbeault operator. For compact (Mn, g), we investigate the first eigenvalue of the operator . As a main tool, we use Weitzenböck formulas, which express the square of the perturbed operator D1/3 + S by the Laplacian of a suitable spinor connection. Here, S runs through a certain class of perturbations. We apply our method to spaces of dimension 6 and 7, in particular, to nearly Kähler and nearly parallel G2-spaces.}},

This leads to two different representations of the volume form in the Hilbert space, and only their product is the grading operator. The index of the even-to-odd part of each of these Dirac operators is 1. We also compute the spectral action for the corresponding Connes-Lott two-point model. There is an additional harmonic oscillator potential for the Higgs field, whereas the Yang-Mills part is unchanged. The total Higgs potential shows a two-phase structure with smooth transition between them: In the spontaneously broken phase below a critical radius, all fields are massive, with the Higgs field mass slightly smaller than the NCG prediction. In the unbroken phase above the critical radius, gauge fields and fermions are massless, whereas the Higgs field remains massive.}},

Recent work of Connes and Chamseddine suggests that they can be taken as natural variables for an invariant description of the dynamics of gravity. We compute the Poisson brackets of the \$\textbackslashlambda\_\{n\}\$'s, and find that these can be expressed in terms of the propagator of the linearized Einstein equations and the energy-momentum of the eigenspinors. We show that the eigenspinors' energy-momentum is the Jacobian matrix of the change of coordinates from the metric to the \$\textbackslashlambda\_\{n\}\$'s. We study a variant of the Connes-Chamseddine spectral action which eliminates a disturbing large cosmological term. We analyze the corresponding equations of motion and find that these are solved if the energy momenta of the eigenspinors scale linearly with the mass. Surprisingly, this scaling law codes Einstein's equations. Finally we study the coupling to a physical fermion field.}},

The intrinsic micro﻿-regional﻿ interactions between hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen and the spatial origins of mechanical stresses that close off blood vessels was investigated here. Multiple localized pressure measurements were analyzed with spatially-matched histochemical images of HA, collagen and vessel perfusion. HA is known to swell, fitting a linear elastic model with total tissue pressure (TTP) increasing above interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) directly with collagen content. However, local TTP appears to originate from collagen area fraction, as well as increased its entropy and fractal dimension, and morphologically appears to be maximized when HA regions are encapsulated by collagen. TTP was inversely correlated with vascular patency and verteporfin uptake, suggesting interstitial hypertension results in vascular compression and decreased molecular delivery in PDAC. Collagenase injection led to acute decreases in total tissue pressure and increased drug perfusion. Large microscopic variations in collagen distributions within PDAC leads to microregional TPP values that vary on the hundred micron distance scale, causing micro-heterogeneous limitations in molecular perfusion, and narrows viable treatment regimes for systemically delivered therapeutics.}},

We consider possible principles to determine that function. These lead to behaviour that, in the limit of hbar to zero and the speed of light is taken to infinity, reproduces the modifications of Newtonian dynamics first proposed by Milgrom. Thus MOND is elucidated as coding the physics of a novel regime of quantum gravity phenomena.

Along this line, a prime question is to find whether gravity is a quantum entity subject to the rules of quantum mechanics. It is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test the quantum coherent behaviour of gravity directly in a laboratory experiment. Here, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two objects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite the weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational interaction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave interferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far apart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription for witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent mediator, through simple correlation measurements between two spins: one embedded in each test mass. Fundamentally, the above entanglement is shown to certify the presence of non-zero off-diagonal terms in the coherent state basis of the gravitational field modes.}},

It turns out that true quantum gravity effects — here defined as observable gravitational interactions between truly quantum objects — could and should be seen (if they occur in nature) using existing technology. A falsification of the low-energy limit in the accessible weak-field regime would also falsify the full theory of quantum gravity, making it enter the realm of testable, potentially falsifiable theories, i.e. becoming real physics after almost a century of pure theorizing. If weak-field gravity between quantum objects is shown to be absent (in the regime where the approximation should apply), we know that gravity then is a strictly classical phenomenon absent at the quantum level.}},

However, understanding the phase diagram and finding fixed points under the renormalization group flow remains a major challenge. In this work we tackle the issue for a tensorial group field theory using the functional renormalization group method. We derive the flow equation for the effective potential at any order restricting to a subclass of tensorial interactions called cyclic melonic and projecting to a constant field in group space. For a tensor field of rank r on U(1) we explicitly calculate beta functions and find equivalence with those of O(N) models but with an effective dimension flowing from r − 1 to zero. In the r − 1 dimensional regime, the equivalence to O(N) models is modified by a tensor specific flow of the anomalous dimension with the consequence that the Wilson-Fisher type fixed point solution has two branches. However, due to the flow to dimension zero, fixed points describing a transition between a broken and unbroken phase do not persist and we find universal symmetry restoration. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to go beyond compact configuration space.}},

This Souriau’s model considers the statistical mechanics of dynamic systems in their “space of evolution” associated to a homogeneous symplectic manifold by a Lagrange 2-form, and defines in case of non null cohomology (non equivariance of the coadjoint action on the moment map with appearance of an additional cocyle) a Gibbs density (of maximum entropy) that is covariant under the action of dynamic groups of physics (e.g., Galileo’s group in classical physics). Souriau Lie Group Thermodynamics was also addressed 30 years after Souriau by R.F. Streater in the framework of Quantum Physics by Information Geometry for some Lie algebras, but only in the case of null cohomology. Souriau method could then be applied on Lie groups to define a covariant maximum entropy density by Kirillov representation theory. We will illustrate this method for homogeneous Siegel domains and more especially for Poincaré unit disk by considering SU(1,1) group coadjoint orbit and by using its Souriau’s moment map. For this case, the coadjoint action on moment map is equivariant. For non-null cohomology, we give the case of Lie group SE(2). Finally, we will propose a new geometric definition of Entropy that could be built as a generalized Casimir invariant function in coadjoint representation, and Massieu characteristic function, dual of Entropy by Legendre transform, as a generalized Casimir invariant function in adjoint representation, where Souriau cocycle is a measure of the lack of equivariance of the moment mapping.}},

abstract = {{It has been often observed that Kähler geometry is essentially a U(1) gauge theory whose field strength is identified with the Kähler form. However it has been pursued neither seriously nor deeply. We argue that this remarkable connection between the Kähler geometry and U(1) gauge theory is a missing corner in our understanding of quantum gravity. We show that the Kähler geometry can be described by a U(1) gauge theory on a symplectic manifold with a slight generalization. We derive a natural Poisson algebra associated with the Kähler geometry we have started with. The quantization of the underlying Poisson algebra leads to a noncommutative U(1) gauge theory which arguably describes a quantized Kähler geometry. The Hilbert space representation of quantized Kähler geometry eventually ends in a zero-dimensional matrix model. We then play with the zerodimensional matrix model to examine how to recover our starting point–Kähler geometry–from the background-independent formulation. The round-trip journey suggests many remarkable pictures for quantum gravity that will open a new perspective to resolve the notorious problems in theoretical physics such as the cosmological constant problem, hierarchy problem, dark energy, dark matter and cosmic inflation. We also discuss how time emerges to generate a Lorentzian spacetime in the context of emergent gravity.}},

In each case the heat kernel coefficients are given in terms of several geometric invariants. These invariants are derived for scalar and spinor theories with various interactions, Yang–Mills fields, gravity, and open bosonic strings.

In section 6, the black hole entropy is derived in various ways. Section 6.1 uses the gravitational path integral for this calculation. Section 6.2 shows how the black hole entropy can be derived from canonical quantum gravity. In section 7.1, arguments from Dvali and Gomez who claim that gravity can be quantized in a way which would be in some sense self-complete are critically assessed.

Ponzano and Regge, expanding on work of Wigner, gave a striking (but unproved) asymptotic formula relating the value of the 6j-symbol, when the dimensions of the representations are large, to the volume of an honest Euclidean tetrahedron whose edge lengths are these dimensions. The goal of this paper is to prove and explain this formula by using geometric quantization.

We construct invariant first-order and second-order self-adjoint elliptic partial differential operators, which can be called "non-commutative" Dirac operators and non-commutative Laplace operators. We construct the corresponding heat kernel for the non-commutative Laplace type operator and compute its first two spectral invariants.

Second, in the noncommutative case, the same construction continues to make sense for an abstract family of spectral triples, and we prove that (in the case of Riemannian signature) the construction yields in fact a spectral triple, which we call a product spectral triple. In the case of Lorentzian signature, the corresponding 'Lorentzian spectral triple' can also be viewed as the 'reverse Wick rotation' of such product spectral triples. This construction of 'Lorentzian spectral triples' fits well into the Krein space approach to noncommutative Lorentzian geometry.}},

This fact permitted us to prove the form of the DFRA operators previously constructed in the usual way. After that, we introduced the solution of its Klein-Gordon equation with a source term. Its solution was accomplished through the retarded, advanced and causal Green functions constructed in this noncommutative ten dimensional DFRA spacetime.

In this noncommutative space the time variable is not commuting with the angular variable in cylindrical coordinates. The possible values that the variable can take go from minus infinity to plus infinity, equally spaced by the scale of noncommmutativity. Possible self-adjoint extensions of the "time operator" are discussed. They give that a measurement of time can be any real value, but time intervals are still quantized.}},
note = {Result of the paper is that in a specific noncommutative space the spectrum of the 'time' variable is discrete. This has the results in the time intervals that are measured are quantized, however the measured time at can be any real number. This is a little confusing, the spectrum and the measured values must be different.
The spacetime in question is rho-Minkowski, which is a noncommutative space, with 4 generators, where their exists a lie algebraic noncommutativity between some of the generators. The time operator only commutes with the x\textasciicircum3 operator and itself. This is then transformed into a set of coordinate that mimic cylindrical coordinates.


A comparison to the more well known kappa-Minkowski is presented and they use analysis of kappa-Minkowski to guide them in their analysis. Which results in statements about about needing to replace the Fourier transform in ordinary quantum mechancis with the Mellin transform.

The angular-Minkowski space doesn't have a classical group symmetry, but a Hopf algebra symmetry given by a Drinfel'd twist (which is a mechanism of producing quantum groups/Hopf algebras).

This paper is quite short and looks like the a shallow dive into the analysis of a specific NCG space. Nothing ground breaking but interesting nonetheless.  },

In this paper, we explain that these various problems result from using the ungraded tensor product; by switching to the graded tensor product, we obtain a new prescription where all of the earlier problems are neatly resolved: in particular, the new product is commutative, associative, transforms correctly under unitaries, and always forms a well defined spectral triple.}},

abstract = {{Contraction is defined for a Lie group to coincide on its Lie algebra with a generalization of contraction as first introduced by Inönü and Wigner. This is accomplished with a sequence of nonsingular coordinate transformations on the group (or nonsingular linear coordinate transformations on its Lie algebra), whose limit is a singular one. Essentially all of the calculations are performed in the algebra. It is assumed that in the limit the association in the algebra (the multiplication law in the group) converges, and this gives a necessary and sufficient condition on the algebra. Once it is satisfied, the new (contracted) algebra is uniquely determined in terms of the original one. It is found that the contracted algebra can be further contracted in the same way, and likewise the algebra so obtained. In this way one obtains a terminating sequence of algebras. Inönü-Wigner contraction corresponds to a sequence terminating at the first contraction. Some properties of the original and contracted algebras are studied, and some specific examples are given. Contraction of a Lie algebra induces contraction of any of its representations. This is examined for the case of finite-dimensional representations. Ray representations are discussed in general. It is shown how the trivial exponent of the Lorentz group changes under contraction to the non trivial one of the Galilei group. Copyright © 1961 by the American Institute of Physics.}},

What about actions from groupoids, or inductive limits of groups? We establish a general result addressing all these matters. Our result provides a first example of a structure which passes to the limit of quantum metric spaces for the propinquity, as well as a new method to construct group actions, including from non-locally compact groups seen as inductive limits of compact groups, on unital C*-algebras.

abstract = {{We review the noncommutative approach to the standard model. We start with the introduction if the mathematical concepts necessary for the definition of noncommutative spaces, and manifold in particular. This defines the framework of spectral geometry. This is applied to the standard model of particle interaction, discussing the fermionic and bosonic spectral action. The issues relating to the calculation of the mass of the Higgs are discussed, as well as the role of neutrinos and Wick rotations. Finally, we present the possibility of solving the problem of the Higgs mass by considering a pregeometric grand symmetry. There are good reasons to believe that spacetime has, at high energies, a quantum structure. We will not dwell too much on these reasons, and just mention the semi-heuristic argument [1, 2] which echoes the so called Heisenberg microscope. The argument of the latter is the following (for a pedagogical introduction see [3, Sect. 1.10]). Try to measure the position of a particle with an ideal microscope, this implies shining light (or some other radiation) on it, and then collecting the scattered light. A precise measurement means short wavelength. But the presence of the scales ¯ h of quantum mechanics, and c of special relativity, imply that a short wavelength photon will have a high momentum, and the unavoidable momentum transfer in the scattering means that immediately after the measurement the information on the momentum is uncertain. If we decide to ignore momentum, and insert G and general relativity in the game, and reason at the same heuristic level, we still have restrictions. Now the problem comes form the fact that concentrating too much energy in too small a volume creates the horizon of a black hole! Again we have a limit to the precision of measurement. Needless to say the Heisenberg microscope is a highly unsatisfactory way to do describe the uncertainty principle (and indeed is off by a 4π factor.) The proper way is to the formalism and interpretation of quantum mechanics where x and p are noncommuting operators acting on a Hilbert space, a physical state is given by a vector or a density matrix, and so on. Unfortunately we cannot play the same game for spacetime, as we do not have a fully fledged theory of quantum gravity. Nevertheless the previous considerations suggest that a way to go is to generalise the usual geometric concepts and build a noncommutative geometry. We will define what we mean by noncommutative geometry as we go along, as the term may encompass different form on noncommutative spaces. We hasten to add, however, that in this case noncommutative geometry is not, or at least is not only, a spacetime with nonzero commutation relations among the position coordinates, as in [4], or in countless other papers which describe variations on this theme, their symmetries, construction of field theories on these spaces and so on. Not only it would impossible to cover all of these, but just citing the main results would make this note too long, a small portion of these can be found in [5] Here we will present the application of the spectral approach to noncommutative geometry. This was pioneered by Alain Connes, and the classic reference is [6]. Other good general references are [7–10]. Given the introductory character of the lectures we privilege review articles and textbook, whenever possible, as references. Although the natural scale of such a generalised geometry is the Planck length, a surprising aspect is that there is an interpretation of the standard model of particle interaction (in a background gravitational field) as a very simple noncommutative geometry. Spacetime is still " classical }},

abstract = {{Noncommutative K\textbackslash"ahler structures were recently introduced by the third author as a framework for studying noncommutative K\textbackslash"ahler geometry on quantum homogeneous spaces. It was subsequently observed that the notion of a positive vector bundle directly generalises to this setting, as does the Kodaira vanishing theorem. In this paper, by restricting to covariant K\textbackslash"ahler structures of irreducible type (those having an irreducible space of holomorphic \$1\$-forms) we provide simple cohomological criteria for positivity, offering a means to avoid explicit curvature calculations. These general results are applied to our motivating family of examples, the irreducible quantum flag manifolds \$\textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\_q(G/L\_S)\$. Building on the recently established noncommutative Borel-Weil theorem, every covariant line bundle over \$\textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\_q(G/L\_S)\$ can be identified as positive, negative, or flat, and hence we can conclude that each K\textbackslash"ahler structure is of Fano type. Moreover, it proves possible to extend the Borel-Weil theorem for \$\textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\_q(G/L\_S)\$ to a direct noncommutative generalisation of the classical Bott-Borel-Weil theorem for positive line bundles.}},

abstract = {{Abstract We have recently proposed a new matrix dynamics at the Planck scale, building on the theory of trace dynamics and Connes noncommutative geometry program. This is a Lagrangian dynamics in which the matrix degrees of freedom are made from Grassmann numbers, and the Lagrangian is trace of a matrix polynomial. Matrices made from even grade elements of the Grassmann algebra are called bosonic, and those made from odd grade elements are called fermionic—together they describe an ‘aikyon’. The Lagrangian of the theory is invariant under global unitary transformations and describes gravity and Yang–Mills fields coupled to fermions. In the present article, we provide a basic definition of spin angular momentum in this matrix dynamics and introduce a bosonic(fermionic) configuration variable conjugate to the spin of a boson(fermion). We then show that at energies below Planck scale, where the matrix dynamics reduces to quantum theory, fermions have half-integer spin (in multiples of Planck’s constant), and bosons have integral spin. We also show that this definition of spin agrees with the conventional understanding of spin in relativistic quantum mechanics. Consequently, we obtain an elementary proof for the spin-statistics connection. We then motivate why an octonionic space is the natural space in which an aikyon evolves. The group of automorphisms in this space is the exceptional Lie group G 2 which has 14 generators [could they stand for the 12 vector bosons and two degrees of freedom of the graviton?]. The aikyon also resembles a closed string, and it has been suggested in the literature that 10-D string theory can be represented as a 2-D string in the 8-D octonionic space. From the work of Cohl Furey and others it is known that the Dixon algebra made from the four division algebras [real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions] can possibly describe the symmetries of the standard model. In the present paper we outline how in our work the Dixon algebra arises naturally and could lead to a unification of gravity with the standard model. From this matrix dynamics, local quantum field theory arises as a low energy limit of this Planck scale dynamics of aikyons, and classical general relativity arises as a consequence of spontaneous localisation of a large number of entangled aikyons. We propose that classical curved space–time and Yang–Mills fields arise from an effective gauging which results from the collection of symmetry groups of the spontaneously localised fermions. Our work suggests that we live in an eight-dimensional octonionic universe, four of these dimensions constitute space–time and the other four constitute the octonionic internal directions on which the standard model forces live.}},

Twistors themselves may be initially pictured as light rays—with a twisting aspect to them related to angular momentum. Twistor theory provides an economical conformally invariant description of quantum wave functions for massless particles and fields, best understood in terms of holomorphic sheaf cohomology, subsequently leading to a non-linear description of anti-self-dual (" left-handed ") gravitational (and Yang-mills) fields. Attempts to remove this anti-self-dual restriction (the googly problem) led to a 40-year blockage to the development of twistor theory as a possible overall approach to fundamental physics. However, in recent years, a more sophisticated approach to this problem has been developed—referred to as palatial twistor theory—whose basic procedures are described here, where a novel generating-function approach to -vacuum Einstein equations is introduced.}},

Four symmetry classes are identified, which correspond to Cartan's symmetric spaces of type C, CI, D, and DIII. A detailed study is made of the systems where the phase shift due to Andreev reflection averages to zero along a typical semiclassical single-electron trajectory. Such systems are particularly interesting because they do not have a genuine excitation gap but support quasiparticle states close to the chemical potential. Disorder or dynamically generated chaos mixes the states and produces novel forms of universal level statistics. For two of the four universality classes, the n-level correlation functions are calculated by the mapping on a free 1D Fermi gas with a boundary. The remaining two classes are related to the Laguerre orthogonal and symplectic random-matrix ensembles. For a quantum dot with an NS-geometry, the weak localization correction to the conductance is calculated as a function of sticking probability and two perturbations breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-rotation invariance. The universal conductance fluctuations are computed from a maximum-entropy S-matrix ensemble. They are larger by a factor of two than what is naively expected from the analogy with normal-conducting systems. This enhancement is explained by the doubling of the number of slow modes: owing to the coupling of particles and holes by the proximity to the superconductor, every cooperon and diffuson mode in the advanced-retarded channel entails a corresponding mode in the advanced-advanced (or retarded-retarded) channel.}},

This parallel transport morphism is determined uniquely by an ordinary differential equation depending on the covariant derivative along X. Based on these parallel transport morphisms, we define a basic set of gauge invariant observables, i.e. functions from the space of connections to the complex numbers. For modules equipped with a Hermitian structure, we prove that this set of observables is separating on the space of gauge equivalence classes of Hermitian connections.

While the origin of such a flow is well understood in continuum approaches, in theories built on discrete structures a firm control of the underlying mechanism is still missing. We shed some light on the issue by presenting a particular class of quantum geometries with a flow in the spectral dimension, given by superpositions of states defined on regular complexes. For particular superposition coefficients parametrized by a real number \$0<\textbackslashalpha<d\$, we find that the spatial spectral dimension reduces to \$d\_s \textbackslashsimeq \textbackslashalpha\$ at small scales. The spatial Hausdorff dimension of such class of states varies between 1 and \$d\$, while the walk dimension takes the usual value \$d\_w=2\$. Therefore, these quantum geometries may be considered as fractal only when \$\textbackslashalpha=1\$, where the "magic number" \$\{d\_s\}\textasciicircum\{\textbackslashrm spacetime\}\textbackslashsimeq 2\$ for the spectral dimension of space\textbackslashemph\{time\}, appearing so often in quantum gravity, is reproduced as well. These results apply, in particular, to special superpositions of spin-network states in loop quantum gravity, and they provide more solid indications of dimensional flow in this approach.}},

A refined version of this approach can be applied for toroidal boundary conditions, i.e., the electrons are confined to the physical interior of the Hall sample. The result turns out to be a nontrivial modification of the p-fold degenerate Haldane-Rezayi wave function.

abstract = {{A remarkably intelligible survey . . . well organized, well written and very clear throughout." â Mathematical Reviews This excellent text, long considered one of the best-written, most skillful expositions of group theory and its physical applications, is directed primarily to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, especially quantum physics. No knowledge of group theory is assumed, but the reader is expected to be familiar with quantum mechanics. And while much of the book concerns theory, readers will nevertheless find a large number of physical applications in the fields of crystallography, molecular theory, and atomic and nuclear physics. The first seven chapters of the book are concerned with finite groups, focusing on the central role of the symmetric group. This section concludes with a chapter dealing with the problem of determining group characters, as it discusses Young tableaux, Yamanouchi symbols, and the method of Hund. The remaining five chapters discuss continuous groups, particularly Lie groups, with the final chapter devoted to the ray representation of Lie groups. The author, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Minnesota, has included a generous selection of problems. They are inserted throughout the text at the place where they naturally arise, making the book ideal for self-study as well as for classroom assignment. 77 illustrations. "A very welcome addition to [the] literature. . . . I would warmly recommend the book to all serious students of Group Theory as applied to Physics." â Contemporary Physics. Index. Bibliography.

We establish a foundation for discussing continuous families of quantum systems. Having done so, topological phases of quantum systems can be defined as deformation classes of continuous families of gapped Hamiltonians. For free particles, there is an additional algebraic structure on the deformation classes leading naturally to notions of twisted equivariant K-theory. In systems with a lattice of translational symmetries, we show that there is a canonical twisting of the equivariant K-theory of the Brillouin torus. We give precise mathematical definitions of two invariants of the topological phases which have played an important role in the study of topological insulators. Twisted equivariant K-theory provides a finer classification of topological insulators than has been previously available.}},

abstract = {{All existing quantum gravity proposals share the same deep problem. Their predictions are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the gravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the electromagnetic field. The fundamental reason is that the gravitational coupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine structure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, the detection of gravitons – the hypothetical quanta of energy of the gravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals – is deemed to be practically impossible. In this letter we adopt a radically different, quantum-information-theoretic approach which circumvents the problem that quantum gravity is hard to test. We propose an experiment to witness quantum-like features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses each in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove the fact that any system (e.g. a field) capable of mediating entanglement between two quantum systems must itself be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on any specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the entanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our argument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is an indirect witness of the quantisation of the field mediating the interaction. Remarkably, this experiment does not require any quantum control over gravity itself. It is also closer to realisation than other proposals, such as detecting gravitons or detecting quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations.}},

Our results show that the UV-divergent part of the entanglement entropy on a fuzzy sphere does not follow an area law, while the entanglement entropy on a commutative sphere does.

Such a slingshot is attractive since fuel is not expended for the acceleration, however it does entail a spacecraft diving into close proximity of the binary, which could be hazardous. It is proposed here that such a slingshot can be performed remotely using a beam of light which follows a boomerang null geodesic. Using a moving black hole as a gravitational mirror, kinetic energy from the black hole is transferred to the beam of light as a blueshift and upon return the recycled photons not only accelerate, but also add energy to, the spacecraft. It is shown here that this gained energy can be later expended to reach a terminal velocity of approximately 133\% the velocity of the black hole. A civilization could exploit black holes as galactic way points but would be difficult to detect remotely, except for an elevated binary merger rate and excess binary eccentricity.}},

The three term recursion relation that constitutes our main result, Theorem 5.2, together with the fact that the functions (g,w) are eigenfunctions of all differential operators on G which are left invariant under G and right invariant under K, provides for each ℓ∈N0 a solution of a matrix valued extension of the Bochner's problem to G.

abstract = {{A numerical evaluation of the discrete path integral for pure lattice gravity, with and without higher derivative terms, and using the lattice analog of the DeWitt gravitational measure, shows the existence of a well-behaved ground state for sufficiently strong gravity (G ⩾ Gc). Close to the continuous critical point separating the smooth from the rough phase of gravity, the critical exponents are estimated using a variety of methods on lattices with up to 15 × 164 = 1 572864 simplices. With periodic boundary conditions (four-torus) the average curvature approaches zero at the critical point. Curvature fluctuations diverge at this point, while the fluctuations in the local volumes remain bounded. The value of the curvature critical exponent is estimated to be δ = 0.626(25), when the critical point is approached from the smooth phase. In this phase, as well as at the criticalpoint, the fractal dimension is consistent with four, the euclidean value. In the (physically unacceptable) rough, collapsed phase the fractal dimensions is closer to two, in agreement with earlier results which suggested a discontinuity in the fractal dimensions at the critical point. For sufficiently small higher derivative coupling, and in particular for the pure Regge-Einstein action, the transition between the smooth and rough phase becomes first order, suggesting the existence of a multicritical point separating the continuous from the discontinuous phase transition line.}},

In the other, there is a U(n) gauge theory on a fuzzy \$S\textasciicircum4\$ with \$ \{\textbackslashcal O\}(n\textasciicircum3)\$ instantons.

Our result is in the framework of Riemannian geometry and can be viewed as analogous to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for manifolds with boundary, although there is a very significant difference between the two cases which is, in a sense, the central topic of the paper. To explain this difference let us begin by recalling that the classical Gauss–Bonnet theorem for a surface X with boundary Y asserts that the Euler characteristic E(X) is given by a formula: where K is the Gauss curvature of X and σ is the geodesic curvature of Y in X. In particular if, near the boundary, X is isometric to the product Y x R+, the boundary integral in (1.1) vanishes and the formula is the same as for closed surfaces. Similar remarks hold in higher dimensions. Now if X is a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension 4, there is another formula relating cohomological invariants with curvature in addition to the Gauss–Bonnet formula. This expresses the signature of the quadratic form on H2(X, R) by an integral formula where p1 is the differential 4-form representing the first Pontrjagin class and is given in terms of the curvature matrix R by p1 = (2π)−2Tr R2. It is natural to ask if (1.2) continues to hold for manifolds with boundary, provided the metric is a product near the boundary. Simple examples show that this is false, so that in general}},

This question is of interest because spectra are geometric invariants and their quantization would, therefore, have the ben-efit of not requiring the modding out of the diffeomorphism group. Further, we discuss the fact that spacetime at the Planck scale need not necessarily be either discrete or continuous. Instead, results from information theory show that spacetime may be simultaneously discrete and continuous in the same way that information can. Finally, we review the finding that a covariant natural ul-traviolet cutoff at the Planck scale implies a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that may become observable.}},

This paper overcomes this barrier by constructing a class of soliton solutions that are capable of superluminal motion and sourced by purely positive energy densities. The solitons are also shown to be capable of being sourced from the stress-energy of a conducting plasma and classical electromagnetic fields. This is the first example of hyper-fast solitons resulting from known and familiar sources, reopening the discussion of superluminal mechanisms rooted in conventional physics.}},

This way we characterize principal (free and proper) actions by a density condition in (multiplier) C*-algebras. We introduce the concept of piecewise triviality to adapt the standard notion of local triviality to fibre products of C*-algebras. In the context of principal actions, we study in detail an example of a non-proper free action with continuous translation map, and examples of compact principal bundles which are piecewise trivial but not locally trivial, and neither piecewise trivial nor locally trivial, respectively. We show that the module of continuous sections of a vector bundle associated to a compact principal bundle is a cotensor product of the algebra of functions defined on the total space (that are continuous along the base and polynomial along the fibres) with the vector space of the representation. On the algebraic side, we review the formalism of connections for the universal differential algebras. In the differential geometry framework, we consider smooth connections on principal bundles as equivariant splittings of the cotangent bundle, as 1-form-valued derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on the structure group, and as axiomatically given covariant differentiations of functions defined on the total space. Finally, we use the Dirac monopole connection to compute the pairing of the line bundles associated to the Hopf fibration with the cyclic cocycle of integration over S\textasciicircum2.}},
