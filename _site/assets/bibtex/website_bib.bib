In support of this point of view, we analyze some examples of saddle-point methods, especially as applied to quantum "tunneling" in nonrelativistic particle mechanics and in cosmology. Along the way we explore some of the interrelationships among different ways of thinking about path-integrals and saddle-point approximations to them.}},

abstract = {{Wick rotation is usually performed by rotating the time coordinate to imaginary values. In a general curved spacetime, the notion of a time coordinate is ambiguous. We note here, that within the tetrad formalism of general relativity, it is possible to perform a Wick rotation directly in the tangent space using considerably less structure: a timelike, future pointing vector field, which need not be Killing or hypersurface orthogonal. This method has the advantage of yielding real Euclidean metrics, even in spacetimes which are not static. When applied to a black hole exterior, the null generators of the event horizon reduce to points in the Euclidean spacetime. Requiring that the Wick rotated holonomy of the null generators be trivial ensures the absence of a `conical singularity' in the Euclidean space. To illustrate the basic idea, we use the tangent space Wick rotation to compute the Hawking temperature by Euclidean methods in a few spacetimes including the Kerr black hole.}},

author = {Visser, Matt},
journal = {arXiv},
eprint = {1702.05572},
abstract = {{It is an article of folklore that the collection of ideas identified as Euclidean quantum gravity may be derived from ordinary Lorentzian signature gravity by the procedure of Wick rotation. This note will attempt to shed some light on this relatively ill-understood procedure. I argue that it proves inappropriate and unhelpful to regard Wick rotation in terms of a complex deformation of the time coordinate. Rather, Wick rotation can more usefully be viewed as a complex deformation of the spacetime metric. This simple reformulation of the Wick rotation procedure, while it leaves flat space physics unaffected, has profound implications for quantum gravity.}},
