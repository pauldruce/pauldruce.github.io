<p><u><strong>PhD in Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK</strong>: <em>2015 - Passed Viva 13/11/2019</em></u></p>
<p>Title: Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Spaces</p>
<p>Supervisor: Prof. John Barrett</p>
<p>For my PhD I worked on an area of mathematics called non-commutative geometry and how it might be useful in the theory of quantum gravity. My research was to investigate the use of called <em>fuzzy spaces</em> as candidates for quantum spacetimes. I investigated the dimension and volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator. I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the possible fuzzy spaces possible.</p>
<p><u><strong>First Class Masters in Mathematics and Physics, University of Warwick, UK</strong>: <em>2011-2015</em></u></p>
<p>Masters Dissertation: Multiferroicity Emerging from Frustrated Spin Interactions</p>
<p>Supervisors: Prof J Staunton and Dr J Lloyd-Hughes</p>
<p>During my time at Warwick, I studied a wide range of mathematics and physics topics. My interests were in both the abstract mathematics and the physics of matter and its constituents. Here is a list of topics I studied during my time at Warwick: Real Analysis, Differential Equations, Groups and Rings, Complex Analysis, Classical Mechanics, Statistical Physics, General Relativity, Solid State Physics, Fluid Dynamics and many more. I managed to maintain an average grade of <span class="math inline">81%</span> throughout my course achieving one of the best marks in the year.</p>
<p><strong><u>2009-2011: King Edward Vi Sixth Form - A Levels:</u></strong> Maths: A*, Physics: A, Chemistry: A. I also completed the AQA baccalaureate during my A levels.</p>
<p><strong><u>2004-2009: Birley Community College. GCSEs:</u></strong> 9 A’s, 2 B’s and one C.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-experience">Teaching Experience</h2>
<p><u><strong>Undergraduate Masters seminar:</strong></u> During my PhD I organised and delivered a two-semester long seminar on the topics surrounding my research to masters students at the University of Nottingham. The seminar was not for credit but was popular and regularly attended by around 10 students. The seminar course resulted in two students choosing noncommutative geometry as the subject of their masters dissertation and one choosing to undertake a PhD with my supervisor. The course resulted in the beginnings of a set of lecture notes being developed, see <a href="{{ site.url}}/assets/PDFs/NCG_Lectures_2018.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>PhD Demonstrating and Marking</u></strong>: Alongside my PhD, I am employed to help students with their questions for various undergraduate mathematics modules for Engineering students, Physics students and Mathematics students. This includes courses such as Introduction to Mathematical Physics (2nd year), Differential Equations and Fourier Analysis (2nd year), Applied Mathematics (1st year) and more. I also mark the mid-term exams and coursework for various modules.</p>
<p><strong><u>GCSE and A Level Tutoring</u></strong>: I am an experienced tutor in mathematics, further mathematics and physics at both GCSE and A-level standards for various exam boards. I have experience in both face-to-face tutoring and online tutoring via a shared whiteboard such as BitPaper. I also possess an Enhanced DBS check and I am trusted by schools to give one-to-one tutorials to their students via the company MyTutor, see my profile <a href="https://www.mytutor.co.uk/tutors/58270/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Undergraduate Revision Classes</u></strong> (2012-2015): As part of Warwick Physics Society, I organised and ran revision lectures on various topics including first year Classical Mechanics, Waves, Electricity and Magnetism courses. As well as 2nd-year Quantum Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory and Optics and Physics of Fluids courses. For the 2nd year Physics course in C programming, the Warwick Physics Society provided workshops to help, generally, first time programmers, get to grips with the language and the general programming mentality. I also updated and maintained the revision guides the society had and created a revision guide for the second year physics module Thermal Physics II (see <a href="{{ site.url}}/assets/PDFs/Thermal Physics II Revision Guide-2013.pdf"> here </a> here).</p>
<h2 id="academic-activities">Academic Activities</h2>
<h3 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h3>
<p>My research interests span a wide area within Mathematical Physics. I am deeply interested in the mathematical description of the universe with emphasis on the precise nature of spacetime. With my recent work investigating the use of noncommutative geometry to model spacetimes with a high energy cutoff. I am also interested in the use of topology and algebraic methods in condensed matter studies.</p>
<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p>I am an enthusiastic advocate for mathematics and science. I was on the organisational committee for the international festival Pint of Science 2019. I helped organise the Nottingham branch where academics from the University of Nottingham go to the pubs of Nottingham to explain their current research to the public in an understandable manner. I am always looking for ways to bring mathematics and science out of the universities and into public view.</p>
<h3 id="past-research-projects">Past Research Projects</h3>
<div style="text-align:left">
<i>PhD Research Project - Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Sapce </i> <span style="float:right">2015-2019</span>
</div>
<p>My PhD research was concerned with the use of finite noncommutative geometries as candidates for quantum spacetimes. These so-called <em>fuzzy spaces</em> possess an energy cutoff whilst retaining Lie group symmetries. My PhD research was to investigate the dimension and volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator. I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the possible fuzzy spaces possible.</p>
<div style="text-align:left">
<i>Masters Research Project - Multiferroicity Emerging from Frustrated Spin Interactions</i> <span style="float:right">2014-2015</span>
</div>
<p>During the Masters’ year of my undergraduate degree, I undertook a research project, supervised by Prof. J. Staunton and Dr. J Lloyd-Hughes, in which we investigated the various spin structures of materials with a multiferroic phase. We aimed to identify what was special about these materials spin structures that caused them to possess a multiferroic phase. This project was conducted with the aim of aiding the design of high temperature multiferroic devices. We specifically studied Cupric Oxide (CuO) which has a multiferroic phase between 213K and 230K using a mean field model. This project resulted in a function model which predicted a multiferroic phase at a temperature which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.</p>
<div style="text-align:left">
<i> Undergraduate Summer Research - Knotted Nematics</i> <span style="float:right">August 2014-September 2014</span>
</div>
<p>This was funded under the Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme and was supervised under G P Alexander at The University of Warwick. The main aim of this research was to develop a construction for describing knotted liquid crystals, specifically knotted nematics. We improved upon existing ideas that used Milnor’s Fibration Theorem and a way to construct an appropriate complex polynomial from a given knot.</p>
