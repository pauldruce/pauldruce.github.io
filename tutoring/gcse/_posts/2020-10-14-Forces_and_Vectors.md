# Hello world

::: {.question}
<u>AS Level:</u><br>
A hot air balloon generates its lift by burning fuel to produce heat that rises. The "balloon" of the hot air balloon then forms a barrier to the motion of the hot gas. This results in the balloon experiencing an upwards force.

A certain hot air balloon is capable of producing an upwards force of 5000 Newtons. The hot air balloon itself has a mass of
â€‹270 kilograms. Given that the average person has a mass of 80 kilograms. What is the maximum number of people that hot air balloon can support in flight?

<u> A Level Extension </u><br>
A hot air balloon is flying over the countryside with the maximum number of people it can support. A gust of wind hits the balloon and results in a horizontal force on the balloon of 200N. Calculate the magnitude of the result force on the balloon. And express the resultant force as a vector.
