When are we are learning physics (from around the ages of 11 to 18) we learn of various equations and formulas that can not be justified without calculus.
As the average physics student in the UK doesn't learn about calculus until the ages of 16-18, they have already gotten used to just memorising equations without questioning them much.

For example, the work done by a force? Say it with me "is force times distance". Then the knowledgable of you may know that this isn't true. Well not all the time. When the force changes as you move, then this equations isn't true anymore - it only works for constant forces.

You've seen some examples where we have to modify this expression to make the energy transferred^[The energy transferred by a force is the work done by a force. I think the term work-done is unhelpful at times to realise what we are calculating.] by a force agree with logic and experiments. The key example is that of the energy required to stretch a spring to a certain extension. The energy required to stretch the spring is equal to the work done against the spring, and assuming no loss of energy to heating or the environment, is equal to work-done by the spring.
