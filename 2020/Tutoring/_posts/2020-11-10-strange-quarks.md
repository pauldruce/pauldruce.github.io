The story of strange quarks starts before the idea of quarks was really invented. It starts with the idea of **strangeness**. This is the property given to certain particles that took a unusually long time to decay.

In the middle of the 20th century, physicists across the globe were busy creating particles. So many different particles were created, the term "zoo of particles" was an appropriate name. These particles varied in mass, in charge, they were rarely stable and often decayed into the more familiar particles. What was strange however, is that there was no particular pattern to how fast or slow these particles might decay.

Some particles with nothing particularly special about their mass or charge, took much longer to decay[^kaons]. Whilst similarly charger and massive particles decayed rapidly.
How could we explain this feature? Well first it was quantified, each particle was described by a certain amount of "strangeness" based off of how long it took to decay.

[^kaons]: Kaons, for instance, are particularly heavy particles and *should* decay quickly, but they are surprisingly stable.  

In 1964, a simple model of just 3 fundamental particles was proposed (along with their anti-particles), which could explain the existence of the zoo of particles. This was the birth of the quark-model of particle physics.

The model used three quarks: the up quark, the down quark and the strange quark. And was sufficient to explain the known particles at that time. With the increasing power of particle colliders, further particles were found which were explained by adding a few more fundamental quarks to the picture.

So what makes the strange quark to *stange*?
To understand this, we need to know about the forces that particles can experience. These are the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. Gravity is too weak to be of concern for the tiny masses that particles have.

The forces we specifically need to have a look at are the strong and weak nuclear forces. These are the forces that keep nuclei together, but they are also the forces that keep the proton and neutron together.
The weak nuclear force is felt by all the quarks and leptons.
