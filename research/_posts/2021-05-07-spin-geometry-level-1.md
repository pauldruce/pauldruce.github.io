 My research is based in non-commutative geometry, for which, a detailed understanding of spinors and spin geometry is imperative.

# Spinors in physics

Spin is one of the first concepts in quantum theory that I remember confusing me.
It simultaneously was easy enough to understand, but there was so much mystery surrounding the concept.
You are essentially told that an atom's spin is similar to its angular momentum but it's not a real spin.
The question then becomes "what does spin really mean?" and this questions leads you deep in to the rabbit hole.
I eventually end up at the Dirac equations and quantum field theory - our current framework for understanding high energy particle physics.
At which point I was still a little confused.
I felt like I had a decent understanding of however spin interacts with the forces of nature.
However, there was still some areas that confused me.

For instance, the Pauli matrices $\sigma^i$ or the Dirac gamma matrices, $\gamma^\mu$ are essential in the description of spin.
The matrices satisfy a set of equations that I'd not seen before in physics or maths:
$$\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu + \gamma^\nu\gamma^\mu = 2\eta^{\mu\nu} = diag(1,-1,-1,-1)$$

These relations define Clifford algebras, which at first glance had no relation to anything physical. But the more I studied these objects, the more everything made sense.
For instance, the relationship between spin and angular momentum became very clear.

However, every question answered provided many more in its place.

So to fully understand spin, spinors and "angular momentum" - whether it be orbital or spin - we will need to understand a few mathematical concepts.

The most important being that of Clifford algebras, representations and fibre bundles.
