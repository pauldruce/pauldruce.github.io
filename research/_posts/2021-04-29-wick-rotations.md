# Wick Rotations Discussion lead by Lisa Glaser
In this session we will discuss a number of papers:

- [@Visser.2017] Matt Visser, “How to Wick rotate generic curved spacetime,” (2017).
- [@Sorkin.2017] Rafael D Sorkin, “Is the spacetime metric Euclidean rather than Lorentzian?,” (2017).
- [@Samuel.2016] Joseph Samuel, “Wick Rotation in the Tangent Space,” (2016).

The main take away from the discussion is that the general procedure of sending $t \mapsto i\tau$ is too naive in practice.
