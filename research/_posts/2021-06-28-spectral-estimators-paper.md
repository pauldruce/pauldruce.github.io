title: Making sense of pointless geometry - A guide for my first paper.
author: Paul Druce
summary: If you smash together quantum uncertainty and geometry you get an unusual subject. The notion of a point disappears, hence it could be called pointless geometry. All familiarity with ordinary geometry is lost, and we are left out it in the wild. My first paper aimed to provide us with some useful tools and concepts. I had hoped to provide the mathematical equivalent of flint and steel for the subject, but maybe it's just a handful of berries. Either way, it's a mechanism to recover a notion of 'dimension' and 'volume' for these pointless geometries.

If you smash quantum uncertainty and geometry together you inevitably lose the notion of a point. All familiar tools in geometry are lost, and we are left out in the wild, without any supplies. My first paper aimed to provide us with some tools, a flint and steel perhaps, but maybe it's just a handful of berries. Either way, it's something.

## Geometry - the human intuition made mathematical

Over the course of my education I've always had a love/hate relationship with maths. It seemed to make everything really complicated, with a really steep learning curve. However, if you persevere you rarely find a better way to convey the ideas that have been developed over the millennia. From classifying polygons in primary school, to classifying the homology groups of n-dimensional spheres in my degrees. Maths has always been complicated, cumbersome and absolutely essential to complex thought.

When I graduated university in 2015, I thought I'd met some of the most complicated structures I'd ever need to meet in physics. I'd mastered the core tenants of undergraduate mathematics such as real and complex analysis, linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations. I'd taken extra modules in geometry, covered curves and surfaces, manifolds and knot theory. I'd even taken courses on mathematical relativity and mathematically rigorous quantum mechanics.

All of which I thought prepared me for a career in research, and by and large it did. But then I found a topic that would hollow me out, and make me feel completely empty of all complex thought. That topic was quantum gravity.

Now, being the quite arrogant and head strong youth at the time, I decided this was a task for me. Step aside world, time for this mediocre white man to come and save the day. It's safe to assume, nothing of the sort happened, and I spent the next 4 years of my life getting my ass kicked trying to become a researcher.

## Non-commutative geometry - the elite four of my life.

I searched, applied and found a PhD program that seemed to suit my skills. It was in a novel and quite complicated area of new mathematics that aimed to unify quantum theory and geometry. I figured this would be prime for some youngster to come and dismiss a few easy results. I was obviously, quite wrong.

However, I spent the next 4 years trying to make sense of the mess that is cutting edge research. And I finally managed to chip in my two-pence. So if you're interested in how to make sense of a space with no points, but a concrete notion of distance, please keep reading.   :slightly_smiling_face:

## Dimension - a simple idea made complicated.

At some point in your life, you become aware that there is a difference between images and reality. One of these differences you will notice is that a picture of your apple can only be viewed from one perspective, or it has to be drawn again. But a real apple, can be viewed from a whole host of perspectives just by rotating it. This difference, amongst others, defines the difference between a 2D object and a 3D object for most people.

However, mathematicians being as they are, were not satisfied with such a human and vague idea of dimension. For instance, if you take the picture of an apple, cut it out, and bend it so that it can be seen from multiple perspectives, does it make it 3D. Under the definitions above, it's unclear and we would need some extra guidance on what is 3D and 2D. If you chase down all the different loose ends and edge cases, you will end up with the mathematical notion of dimension and geometry.

So bear that in mind when the mathematics gets a bit cumbersome.
