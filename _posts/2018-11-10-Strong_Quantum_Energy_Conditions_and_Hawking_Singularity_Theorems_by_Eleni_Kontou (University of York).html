  <p>These are my notes from this seminar. They are not a complete recount of the talk and are mainly the motivation and main ideas behind the approach.</p>
  <p><strong>The overall aim and result(?) is a singularity theorem that is obeyed by quantum fields.</strong> - this means that the normal singularity theorems are not obeyed by quantum fields? Something I was not aware of, but probably should be
    aware of.</p>
  <p>First up, we need to know what we are dealing with, what is a singularity? Naïve definition is “place where the curvature diverges”. This is a bad definition, because we don’t know how to properly talk about a <em>place</em> when curvature
    diverse and the metric tensor is not defined there. Or maybe just in component form, not sure. My relativity isn’t all that great anymore.</p>
  <p>A better definition</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A spacetime is singular if it has at least one complete geodesic</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jorma Louko spoke up at this point, asking about alternative definitions of a singularity such as saying a spacetime is singular if it has an incomplete geodesic that cannot be completed by adding points to the manifold. To get rid of cases such
    as <span class="math inline">\(M/\{*\}\)</span> and other pathological examples. But Eleni said that the theorems they have shown are using the above definition and it its a less restrictive condition and therefore makes the theorems stronger.

  <h4 id="general-structure-of-a-singularity-theorem">General Structure of a singularity theorem</h4>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Causality conditions - this is a statement relating to the existence s of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_surface">Cauchy surface</a></li>
    <li>Initial or Boundary conditions - this is a statement about the existence of a <em>trapper surface</em> - this was a new concept to me, Eleni explained it as a space-like hyper surface for which 2 null normals have negative expansion. But this
      didn’t embellish the concept to a useable degree. Not for me anyways. Here is the wiki article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_surface">trapped surfaces</a> but even that isn’t too detailed. I think I should go find the
      explanation given in Hawking and Ellis.</li>
    <li>The energy conditions. There are two of them
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Penrose</strong> - Null energy conditions, which is a statement: <span class="math inline">\(R_{ab} l^a l^b \geq 0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(l^a\)</span> is null. So I guess we just take vector fields <span
            class="math inline">\(l\)</span> that are null. I’m not sure how general a vector field we take or whether there are any symmetry requirements etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Hawking</strong> Strong energy condition, which is a similar looking statement <span class="math inline">\(R_{ab} U^a U^b \geq 0\)</span> where now <span class="math inline">\(U^a\)</span> is a timelike vector field.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Then the proofs requires the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raychaudhuri_equation">Raychaudhuri equation</a>. This is not something I’d heard of before. But its a <em>related article</em> on wikipedia so much be fairly well known. Most
    of this stuff looks like it is mentioned in Hawking and Ellis, which I am slowly making my way through. Too many books to read.</p>
  <p>Eleni presented the Raychaudhuri equation in the following way:</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(\dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{n-1} \theta^2 - 2 \sigma^2 - R_{ab}U^aU^b\)</span></p>
  <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is the expansion and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the shear. But I’m not familiar with what this really mean. (From wikipedia on <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(general_relativity)">congruence</a>, you can find that $<em>{ab} $ is the expansion tensor which is given in terms of some metric on a hyper surface which has vectors which are perpendicular to
      the vector field associated to the geodesic (a vague guess at this point). and the symmetrised covariant derivative of a vector field. And the expansion tensor contains both the <span class="math inline">\(\theta =\)</span> trace and $</em>{ab}
    = $ the antisymmetric part.</p>
  <h4 id="proof-structure">Proof structure</h4>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Initial conditions imply that the geodesics start focusing (I’m guessing there is a precise way to talk about focusing)</li>
    <li>Energy conditions implies that the focussing continues? I’m guessing this is the snowballing feature you need for a singularity to occur.</li>
    <li>Causal conditions imply that there are no focal points. (Not sure what this meant, but it didn’t seem super relevant to the talk).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These three steps give us geodesic incompleteness.</p>
  <h3 id="problems-to-be-fixed">Problems (to be fixed)</h3>
  <p>The strong energy condition is too strong and matter models that we know don’t satisfy it’s property.</p>
  <p>An example of a minimally coupled real scalar field violates the Strong Energy Condition, whenever the mass is high or if its derivatives vanished <strong>at any point in the manifold</strong>. I think all quantum fields violate this property as
    well so it’s an issue.</p>
  <h4 id="developments">Developments</h4>
  <p>There are a few ideas floating around the academic world. The first is too take averaged energy conditions, rather than a condition that has to hold every where. An example formula is:</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \int_\gamma \rho f^2(\tau) d\tau \geq 0\)</span></p>
  <p>this wasn’t really elaborated on, but I’m guessing <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the geodesic and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the energy density and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is some random
    function, not too sure what conditions it needs to satisfy.</p>
  <p>Another idea is that of quantum inequalities.</p>
  <p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \int_\gamma f^2(\tau) \langle\rho^\text{quant} \rangle \omega(\gamma(\tau)) \geq -A\)</span></p>
  <p>This again wasn’t really delved into (or I just can’t remember and didn’t write anything down in my notes). But the value <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> depends on the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. And this is a
    restriction of the magnitude and duration of any negative energy densities.</p>
  <h5 id="the-rest-of-the-talk-was-about-algebraic-quantum-field-theory-and-elenis-actual-research-but-i-was-lost-somewhere-in-the-wealth-of-formulas-and-failed-to-gain-anything-else-from-this-talk.">The rest of the talk was about algebraic quantum
    field theory and Eleni’s actual research but I was lost somewhere in the wealth of formula’s and failed to gain anything else from this talk.</h5>
  <h3 id="take-aways-and-final-comments">Take aways and final comments</h3>
  <p>So I think the aim is to show that semi-classical results are not enough to protect us from singularities forming before the quantum gravity regime. This is what I understood from the discussions that occurred. That the investigation into more
    realistic singularity theorems will still allow singularities to form, and therefore the semi-classical picture will need to be replaced by a theory of quantum gravity (in whatever form that may occur in).</p>
  <p>Semiclassical approach are also some of the most interesting results of modern day physics. Which blackhole entropy and Hawking radiation etc all coming from this sort of approach. So I definitely think this sort of research is needed for
    providing food for thought and providing some thought pathways for quantum gravity research.</p>
  <p>This whole approach becomes much harder when you move from vector fields to spinor fields or anything else. Which is not a surprise to me. And there are not many results in this area. It would be interesting to see more active research into
    fermions, however there are currently no massless fermions that have been detected, so that would add complications to the concept, where as massless fields provide an already fruitful and complex playground.</p>
