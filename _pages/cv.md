and how it might be useful in the theory of quantum gravity. My research was to
investigate the use of called _fuzzy spaces_ as candidates for quantum
spacetimes. I investigated the dimension and volume of these spaces by analysing
the spectrum of the Dirac operator. I also investigated the role of Lie group
symmetries in restricting the fuzzy spaces possible. -->

<!--
**Undergraduate Masters seminar:**  I organised and delivered a two-semester long seminar on the topics surrounding my research to masters students at the University of Nottingham. The seminar was not for credit but was popular and regularly attended by around 10 students. The seminar course resulted in two students choosing noncommutative geometry as the subject of their masters dissertation and one choosing to undertake a PhD with my supervisor. The course resulted in the beginnings of a set of lecture notes being developed, see <a href="{{ site.url}}/assets/PDFs/NCG_Lectures_2018.pdf">here</a>.

**PhD Demonstrating and Marking**: Alongside my PhD, I was employed to help students with their questions for various undergraduate mathematics modules for Engineering students, Physics students and Mathematics students. This includes courses such as Introduction to Mathematical Physics (2nd year), Differential Equations and Fourier Analysis (2nd year), Applied Mathematics (1st year) and more. I also mark the mid-term exams and coursework for various modules.

**GCSE and A Level Tutoring**: I am an experienced tutor in mathematics, further mathematics and physics at both GCSE and A-level standards for various exam boards. I have experience in both face-to-face tutoring and online tutoring via a shared whiteboard such as BitPaper. I also possess an Enhanced DBS check and I am trusted by schools to give one-to-one tutorials to their students via the company MyTutor, see my profile [here](https://www.mytutor.co.uk/tutors/58270/).

**Undergraduate Revision Classes** (2012 - 2015): As part of Warwick Physics Society, I organised and ran revision lectures on various topics including first year Classical Mechanics, Waves, Electricity and Magnetism courses. As well as the 2nd-year Quantum Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory and Optics and Physics of Fluids courses. For the 2nd year Physics course in C programming, I  provided workshops to help, generally, first time programmers,  get started with the language and the general programming mentality. I also updated and maintained the revision guides the society had and created a revision guide for the second year physics module Thermal Physics II.

# Academic Activities

**Research Interests:** Mathematical descriptions of the universe, spacetime, noncommutatie geometry.

<!-- My research interests span a wide area within Mathematical Physics. I am deeply
interested in the mathematical description of the universe with emphasis on the
precise nature of spacetime. With my recent work investigating the use of
noncommutative geometry to model spacetimes with a high energy cutoff. I also
interested in any novel use of mathematics in physical situations, such as the
use of topology and algebraic methods in condensed matter studies. -->

**Outreach:** Organized Pint of Science 2019 in Nottingham

<!-- I am an enthusiastic advocate for mathematics and science. I was on the
organisational committee for the international festival Pint of Science 2019. I
helped organise the Nottingham branch where academics from the University of
Nottingham go to the pubs of Nottingham to explain their current research to the
public in an understandable manner. I am always looking for ways to bring
mathematics and science out of the universities and into public view. -->

**Research Projects:**

- PhD Research Project - Spectral Geometry of Fuzzy Space <span
style="float:right;">2015 - 2019</span>
<!-- <center>*Keywords:* Noncommutative geometry, Monte Carlo simulations, spectral geometry, quantum gravity, symmetries in physics</center>
My PhD research was concerned with the use of finite noncommutative geometries as candidates for quantum spacetimes. These so-called *fuzzy spaces* possess an energy cutoff whilst retaining Lie group symmetries. My PhD research was to investigate the dimension and volume of these spaces by analysing the spectrum of the Dirac operator. I also investigated the role of Lie group symmetries in restricting the possible fuzzy spaces possible. -->
- Masters Research Project - Multiferroicity Emerging from Frustrated Spin
Interactions <span style="float:right;">2014 - 2015</span>
<!-- <center> *Keywords:*
Solid-state physics, Theoretical physics, mathematical modelling, frustrated systems, quantum mechanics.</center>
During the Masters’ year of my undergraduate degree, I undertook a research project, supervised by Prof. J. Staunton and Dr. J. Lloyd-Hughes, in which we investigated the various spin configurations of materials with a multiferroic phase. We aimed to identify what was special about these materials spin configurations that caused them to possess a multiferroic phase. This project was conducted with the aim of aiding the design of high temperature multiferroic devices. We specifically studied Cupric Oxide (CuO) which has a multiferroic phase between
213K and 230K, primarily by using mean field model. This project resulted in a functional model which predicted a multiferroic phase at a temperature which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. -->
- Undergraduate Summer Research - Knotted Nematics <span
style="float:right;">Summer 2014</span>
<!-- <center> *Keywords:* Condensed Matter, Mathematical Physics, Liquid Crystals, statistical physics</center>
This was funded under the Undergraduate Research Scholarship Scheme and was supervised under G. P. Alexander at The University of Warwick.
The main aim of this research was to develop a construction for describing knotted liquid crystals, specifically knotted nematics.
We improved upon existing ideas that used Milnor's Fibration Theorem and developed a method to construct the necessary complex polynomial for Milnor's theorem, for a given knot. -->
