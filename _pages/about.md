Hi, how’s it going? I’m Paul, this is my site.

I’ve recently (July 2020) graduated with my PhD from the University of Nottingham, UK. I worked with Prof. John Barrett on Non-commutative Geometry and Quantum Gravity. If you are interested finding out more about this topic I suggest that you look at the documents in in: [Research]({{ site.url}}/research). My PhD thesis contains a thorough introduction to the subject of non-commutative geometry via finite spectral triples.

I try to attend a couple of conferences every year in Europe, usually on non-commutative geometry/gravity oriented topics, or on mathematics education.

I am an experienced academic tutor for mathematics and physics. I tutor all levels ranging from GCSE, A level to University level. I have experience as a course demonstrator for university level course also.
I am using this site to host notes and questions that I make for my students so that others may benefit from them also.

I have a profile at [https://www.mytutor.co.uk/tutors/58270/](https://www.mytutor.co.uk/tutors/58270/) if you’d like an easy and safe way to contact me about online tutoring.
I can also offer tutoring outside of MyTutor which is cheaper that what is stated on my profile for MyTutor. This is due to the overheads that MyTutor charge for using there service.

Feel free to contact me about tutoring or any other aspect of my site by sending me an email. [Click here to send me an email](mailto:pjdruce+website@gmail.com).
